"After his historic guilty verdict, Trump is focused on revenge",https://www.yahoo.com/news/historic-guilty-verdict-trump-focused-110000596.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",9:50 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"Donald Trump wants to talk about revenge, and neither Sean Hannity nor Dr. Phil can stop him.
Both have tried.
Fresh off his historic guilty verdict in New York, Trump’s public comments, including in interviews with both men, have increasingly focused on the idea of “retribution” against his enemies if he returns to the White House.
It’s rhetoric driven by Trump’s obsession that President Joe Biden

and Democrats orchestrated a series of legal problems intended to derail his presidential campaign — a political persecution theory not supported by the facts.
On May 30, a New York jury unanimously found Trump guilty on 34 counts related to falsifying business records tied to a $130,000 payment he made to an adult film star during the 2016 election. The Biden administration had nothing to do with the case.
But for Trump, it’s all politics, and revenge may need to be meted out.
“Well, revenge does take time, I will say that,” Trump said during a Thursday interview with Dr. Phil. “And sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest. Sometimes it can.”
Trump has done at least five interviews since his guilty verdict. In all five, he has talked about possible retribution.
“I think there should be concern,” said Ty Cobb, the attorney who served as a White House attorney during the Trump administration. “From a 30,000-foot view, what I see is Trump angrier now than he was before because he is convicted now.”
""President Trump has made clear that success will be the best revenge,"" Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes said. ""When others have weaponized government and legal institutions against him for political interference, he will return these institutions to their constitutional purpose of protecting Americans’ liberty and creating a safe and prosperous nation again.""
The Dr. Phil interview came one day after Trump sat down with Hannity and at times seemed to debate himself over the idea of exacting revenge.
At one point, Trump said “they’re wrong” when the Fox News host asked about those who say Trump will use his administration for revenge, but in the same breath, he laid out potential opportunities.
“Look when this election is over, based on what they’ve done, I would have every right to go after them,” Trump said. “And it’s easy because it’s Joe Biden, and you see all the criminality, all of the money that’s going into the family and him, all of this money from China, from Russia, from Ukraine.”
Hannity tried to steer Trump away from the idea of revenge, at one point interrupting to try to encourage him to say political retribution “has to stop.”
Dr. Phil, too, tried to get Trump to say he would not seek revenge if he wins in November.
“That is a big issue and I leaned very strongly into the position of saying, ‘Look, this is not going to help this country,’” Dr. Phil told CNN of his interview with Trump.
In other interviews and public appearances, Trump has made similar comments.
On Tuesday, in an interview with the conservative outlet Newsmax, Trump seemed to float the possibility of imprisoning his political opponents if he becomes president again.
“So, you know, it’s a terrible, terrible path that they’re leading us to, and it’s very possible that it’s going to have to happen to them,” Trump said.
“Does that mean the next president does it to them? That’s really the question,” he added.
He has also suggested that there would be a “breaking point” for the public if he is sentenced to jail time or house arrest, as he awaits his sentencing set for July 11.
An open desire to seek revenge on political enemies is not something new for Trump or his supporters.
While still president in 2020, Trump took to social media to ask “Where are all of the arrests?” echoing his supporters’ criticism that his own attorney general, William Barr, had not arrested the likes of Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton over what Trump said was illegal activity tied to special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.
Trump also made “lock her up” a rallying cry during his 2016 campaign against Clinton, promising his supporters he would put the former secretary of state in jail if elected. Trump recently denied ever saying “lock her up” despite ample video of him saying just that throughout the 2016 election.
Trump often portrays his calls for retribution as something he’s doing on behalf of all his supporters.
“I know a lot of Republicans who want retribution,” Trump told NBC News on Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago. “They want to do that. We’re going to see what happens.”
He told a crowd at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference that “for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.” In January, he said on Fox News that he is “not going to have time for retribution” if elected — comments that came just hours after he sent out a fundraising email again telling supporters “I AM YOUR RETRIBUTION.”
But as the full weight of his legal problems have come into view this year — and especially since his guilty verdict — this revenge-fueled language has taken center stage.
“Even Hannity recognized that this was dangerous territory and tried to reel him in,” said Cobb, who, while in the White House, helped coordinate the internal response to Mueller’s Russia probe. “Trump would have none of it.”
Cobb said he believes the nation’s institutions would hold up if Trump tried to seek clearly politically motivated revenge but that it was a situation nevertheless fraught with peril.
“I think the checks and balances are adequate to withstand these instincts because he has to get people to carry them out,” he added.
For Trump’s political base, the renewed focus on exacting revenge from political opponents has support.
“I agree with him,” said Adam Radogna, a 35-year-old Trump supporter from Cleveland. “Obviously nothing, you know, against the law. But he’s just saying, ‘Hey, we are going to go after you because you’re going after me.’”
Parker Shonts, a 22-year-old Trump supporter from Fowlerville, Michigan, said it’s about “accountability.”
“I would say ‘revenge’ is a campaigning buzzword, but ‘accountability’ would seem more apt,” he said.
Calls for revenge-seeking among Trump supporters again intensified Thursday when a federal judge ordered former Trump adviser Steve Bannon to report to prison July 1 to start a four-month sentence for defying subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee. The news angered Trump supporters and prompted Bannon to issue direct threats.
“Don’t pray for me. Pray for my enemies,” Bannon said Thursday. “They’re the ones who need it.”
In response to Bannon's being ordered to prison, Trump posted on Truth Social that members of the Jan. 6 committee should be indicted.
“INDICT THE UNSELECT J6 COMMITTEE FOR ILLEGALLY DELETING AND DESTROYING ALL OF THEIR ‘FINDING!’” Trump wrote.
CORRECTION (June 10, 2024, 11:19 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the date of Trump’s guilty verdict. It was May 30, not 31.

Biden Administration Considers Protection for Migrant Spouses of U.S. Citizens,https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-administration-considers-protection-migrant-113535008.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",5:05 PM GMT+5:30,5 min read,"The Biden

administration is considering a proposal to protect migrant spouses of U.S. citizens from deportation and allow them to work in the country legally, according to four officials with knowledge of the discussions.
The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said that no final decision had been made and that the shape of the policy was unclear. Any such program could also provide some spouses an easier route to obtain U.S. citizenship.
The proposal comes as President Joe Biden has moved to address political liabilities in his immigration policy in recent days.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
Last week, he moved to bar asylum for migrants crossing into the United States as part of an effort to toughen border enforcement, eliciting criticism from members of his own party. And now, a move to protect immigrants living in the country without legal status could help Biden address some of the fierce resistance that order elicited and shore up support among immigrant advocates, Latino voters and his progressive base.
The program said to be under consideration is known as “parole in place,” which has been used in the past for other populations, like families of military members. It gives immigrants living in the United States without legal permission protection from deportation for a certain period of time and access to a work permit.
Crucially, it also makes it easier for some immigrants to gain new access to a green card and a path to U.S. citizenship.
Generally, unlawful entry into the country blocks people’s access to U.S. citizenship in cases in which they would have otherwise been eligible, like being married to a U.S. citizen. Parole in place, however, helps some immigrants obtain a “lawful immigration status” and become eligible to begin the process of becoming citizens.
It is unclear how many people such a program could affect.
Biden’s executive order last week prompted immediate blowback, with some congressional Democrats likening it to a Trump-era measure to stop migrants from gaining access to protections in the United States.
“While there are some differences from Trump’s actions, the reality is that this utilizes the same failed enforcement-only approach, penalizes asylum seekers and furthers a false narrative that these actions will ‘fix’ the border,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said in a statement last week.
Even as he announced a restrictive border policy last week, Biden appeared to indicate that he was considering more progressive moves on immigration.
“For those who say the steps I’ve taken are too strict, I say to you that — be patient,” Biden said Tuesday.
A White House spokesperson said Sunday that the administration had been considering many options.
“As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
Immigration advocates have left briefings with the White House optimistic about the potential for the protection, but also did not receive any indication that the administration would act right away.
Immigrant advocacy groups like Fwd.US have said that more than 1 million spouses of U.S. citizens are in the country without legal status.
“We are optimistic and working tirelessly to ensure that President Biden takes action to protect the long-term undocumented in our country, including the estimated 1.1 million undocumented people in the U.S. who are spouses of an American citizen,” said Andrea Flores, a former administration official and vice president of immigration policy at Fwd.US.
“Doing so would fulfill his Day 1 promise to keep these families together,” she said.
Recent surveys show many Americans, including Democrats and Latinos, favor both tougher immigration enforcement and legal pathways to citizenship.
The embrace of more restrictive policies has come as more cities and states have scrambled to accommodate record numbers of migrants entering the country, and as an increasing number of Republican candidates nationwide have played on fears that migrants pose a threat to jobs, elections and the cultural identity of the nation, even as they run in races far from the border.
Biden’s shift on immigration has been seen by some political strategists as a play to neutralize the issue for white, blue-collar voters in Midwestern swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. But a perception that Biden is echoing the Trump administration’s playbook or prioritizing enforcement over improving legal pathways to citizenship risks depressing the vote among younger Latinos and progressives who have powered major Democratic victories across the Southwest.
Many Mexican American and Latino activists and elected officials in California, Arizona and Nevada have come of age and entered politics through immigrant-rights movements.
Charles Franklin, who directs the Marquette Law School Poll, said that respondents in Wisconsin polling tended to see former President Donald Trump as better on the issue of immigration than Biden by a 2-to-1 ratio, a potentially insurmountable hurdle for the president this late in the race.
The best argument for Biden’s tougher enforcement policies, Franklin said, might be to reduce the salience of the issue among independents and swing voters, whose views remain more persuadable but whose response is an open question.
“The percentage of Democrats who support deportation is surprisingly high, but he has a bigger faction within his party that is quite troubled by his recent actions,” Franklin said. “It is a divided set of gains and losses for him with these policies.”
The Trump campaign last week made its own play for Latino voters by rebranding its “Latinos Trump” effort to “Latino Americans for Trump.” Campaign officials said the new label was meant to draw Latino voters by emphasizing a unifying American identity. But Latino historians and researchers have also called it a strategic move to drive a wedge among Hispanic voters, some of whom are concerned by the arrival of new migrants.
The American Civil Liberties Union has indicated that it will sue the Biden administration over Biden’s measure limiting asylum access at the southern border.
On Sunday, Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, said the administration was prepared to take on any legal challenges to Biden’s executive action.
“I anticipate they will sue us,” Mayorkas, appearing on ABC’s “The Week,” said of the potential for lawsuits. “We stand by the legality of what we have done. We stand by the value proposition.”

Republican contenders for Mitt Romney’s open US Senate seat face off in Utah debate,https://www.yahoo.com/news/republican-contenders-mitt-romney-open-041802437.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",9:48 AM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Four Utah Republicans battling to win the seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney face off Monday evening in a debate that could begin to gauge the type of conservative who most appeals to voters statewide.
The marquee event in a marathon week of primary debates will test former President Donald Trump's broad influence in Utah, one of the few red states that has been hesitant to embrace him. Trump's day-of endorsement of a little-known mayor helped the local official to win the party nomination over nearly a dozen contenders at the April convention.
Romney has long been the face of the party’s more moderate wing, and his retirement from the Senate opens a door for candidates farther to the right. Observers are closely watching whether voters select a successor whose politics align more with Romney’s or with Utah’s other U.S. senator, Trump supporter Mike Lee.
While moderate U.S. Rep. John Curtis is considered the favorite going into the June 25 primary, convention victor Trent Staggs and former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson, another Trump supporter, could push Utah politics further right in the post-Romney era.
Curtis, Wilson and businessman Jason Walton had already guaranteed their spots on the primary ballot through signature gathering before the convention and will be joined on the debate stage by Staggs.
Staggs, 49, built his base by calling state GOP delegates and courting the endorsements of Trump and many of his allies nationwide. The mayor of Riverton, a suburb south of Salt Lake City, was the first candidate to enter the Senate race, even before Romney announced he was not seeking reelection. Staggs' convention victory may not translate to success at the ballot box, as Republican Party nominations historically have had little bearing on the decisions of Utah voters.
Curtis has been compared to Romney for pushing back against hardliners in his party, particularly on climate change, but has distanced himself from the retiring senator while campaigning for his seat. The 63-year-old Republican congressman and former mayor of Provo began his political career as a county-level Democratic Party official. He's now the longest-serving member of Utah’s U.S. House delegation and has pitched himself as the only candidate who already understands the inner workings of Capitol Hill.
Wilson, who is endorsed by Gov. Spencer Cox and other top state officials, insists he's already had the greatest impact on Utah residents as a state legislative leader. As House speaker, he oversaw years of tax cuts and budget negotiations that he says will help him fight federal overspending. Wilson, 55, has touted plans to soften federal regulations that he says stand in the way of local officials detaining immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally.
The winner of the Republican Senate primary will face Democrat Caroline Gleich, a mountaineer and environmental activist, in November. Utah has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since 1970.
The Republican Senate debate is one of three scheduled for Monday in Utah. Challengers for two of the state's four congressional seats are set to debate earlier in the day. Candidates for governor, attorney general and Curtis' open U.S. House seat will face off Tuesday and Wednesday.

"Trump to undergo probation interview Monday, a required step before his New York sentencing",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-undergo-probation-interview-monday-195325462.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",1:23 AM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to be interviewed by New York probation officials Monday, a required step before his July sentencing in his criminal hush money case, according to three people familiar with the plan.
Trump will do the interview via a computer video conference from his residence at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, the people told The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose the plans publicly.
One of Trump's lawyers, Todd Blanche

, will be present for the interview. People convicted of crimes in New York usually meet with probation officials without their lawyers, but the judge in Trump's case, Juan Merchan, said in a letter Friday that he would allow Blanche's presence.
The usual purpose of a pre-sentencing probation interview is to prepare a report that will tell the judge more about the defendant, and potentially help determine the proper punishment for the crime.
Such reports are typically prepared by a probation officer, a social worker or a psychologist working for the probation department who interviews the defendant and possibly that person’s family and friends, as well as people affected by the crime.
Presentence reports include a defendant’s personal history, criminal record and recommendations for sentencing. It will also include information about employment and any obligations to help care for a family member. It is also a chance for a defendant to say why they think they deserve a lighter punishment.
A jury convicted Trump of falsifying business records at his own company as part of a broader scheme to buy the silence of people who might have told embarrassing stories about him during the 2016 presidential campaign. One $130,000 payment went to a porn actor, Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denied.
Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, says he is innocent of any crime and that the criminal case was brought to hurt his chances to regain the White House.
Trump's campaign spokesman, Steven Cheung, said in statement Sunday that President Joe Biden's Democratic Party allies “continue to ramp up their ongoing Witch-Hunts, further abusing and misusing the power of their offices to interfere in the presidential election.”
“President Trump and his legal team are already taking necessary steps to challenge and defeat the lawless Manhattan DA case,” he said.
Merchan has scheduled Trump's sentencing for July 11. He has discretion to impose a wide range of punishments, ranging from probation and community service to up to four years in prison.

"Biden, Trump neck and neck nationally, in battleground states: CBS Poll",https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-trump-neck-neck-nationally-145940591.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",8:29 PM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"President Biden and former President Trump are basically tied nationally and in battleground states, according to new polling from CBS News.
The CBS News/YouGov poll found that Trump received 50 percent support nationally among likely voters, while Biden received 49 percent. In battleground states, 50 percent of likely voters selected Biden, while 49 percent backed Trump, according to CBS.
The poll also found that Trump’s recent conviction in the New York hush money case is not a major issue for most voters when deciding whom to support. More than half of respondents said that the guilty verdict was “not a factor” in their decision, 28 percent said it was a “major factor” and 17 percent said it was a “minor factor.”
Instead, an overwhelming majority said that issues like the economy, inflation and the state of the democracy would be the major factors in their votes.
The poll also found that Biden had the edge over Trump among key voting groups. Eighty-one percent of Black likely voters said they would support Biden, while 18 percent said they would back Trump.
Fifty-four percent of surveyed women also said they support Biden, while 45 percent support Trump. Independents are more divided when asked whether they would support Biden or Trump, with 50 percent selecting Biden and 48 percent choosing the former president.
The poll comes as the two front-runners are barreling toward a likely 2020 rematch in November. Trump and Biden are also neck and neck according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s national polling average, which shows Trump with 45.5 percent support and Biden with 44.7 percent.
The poll was conducted June 5-7 among 2,063 U.S. adult residents. It also included an oversample in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The poll has a margin of error is 3.2 percentage points among all adults and 3.8 points among registered voters.

"Biden, France's Macron reach agreement on using Russian assets for Ukraine",https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-frances-macron-reach-agreement-155119638.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",9:21 PM GMT+5:30,1 min read,"BELLEAU, France (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Sunday he had reached an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron on the use of profits from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.
Asked if the two men had discussed the issue and whether they had come up with an agreement, Biden replied ""Yes and yes.""
The Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan now and secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.
Around 260 billion euros ($280.9 billion) of Russian central bank funds are frozen worldwide, most of it in the EU. The funds generate 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion euros a year in profit, which the EU says is not contractually owed to Russia and therefore represents a windfall.
The idea, championed by the U.S., is to use this profit as a steady revenue stream to service a large loan of $50 billion that could be raised on the market. Russia says any diversion of the profits from its frozen funds would amount to theft.
Tapping profits from Russian assets has drawn concerns from some countries, but a U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday that the United States and its G7 partners were making progress.

Biden is lagging in key swing states. But white non-college voters are keeping him afloat in Wisconsin.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-lagging-key-swing-states-170924839.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",10:39 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"Biden is currently trailing Trump in several critical battleground states ahead of November.
But of all the swing states, Wisconsin has largely been the most receptive to Biden's message.
Biden has retained a significant level of support from the state's bloc of white non-college voters.
In 2020, Wisconsin was one of Joe Biden's most important electoral victories, as he successfully clawed back the Midwestern swing state that was narrowly won by Donald Trump in 2016.
While Democrats need to perform strongly in the liberal population centers of Milwaukee and Madison in order to win statewide elections, the party still retains a significant level of support in many rural communities. And it's Biden's support among white voters without a college degree — a huge voting bloc in these areas — that's currently keeping him afloat in Wisconsin.
Among the seven major swing states, Biden currently trails Trump by at least three points in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina, according to Real Clear Polling averages.
In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Biden has smaller deficits against Trump in the polling averages.
But in Wisconsin, Biden is often tied with Trump in polling, or has a slim lead. And it's the backing of many white working-class voters that has been critical for the president.
The most recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Biden leading Trump by six points (50% to 44%) among registered voters, while a recent Cook Political Report survey had Biden and Trump tied at 45% among Wisconsin voters.
In the Quinnipiac poll, Wisconsin voters gave Biden positive marks on issues like abortion rights and the preservation of democracy. But even on the question of who would better handle international conflicts — where Trump has opened up a lead in many recent polls — the former president only led Biden by one point (48% to 47%).
When it came to economic issues, Trump had an eight-point lead over Biden (52% to 44%) in Wisconsin, per Quinnipiac, a relatively stable number for the incumbent on an issue where he has struggled in national polling. For Biden, the Wisconsin number represents a much more positive outlook from voters compared to his standing in states like Arizona and Nevada.
Among white voters in Wisconsin, Biden actually led Trump by four points (50% to 46%) in the Quinnipiac poll. And college-educated white voters in Wisconsin backed Biden by 27 points (61% to 34%).
But among white voters without college degrees, Biden only trailed Trump by eight points (44% to 52%), a deficit that is much narrower than in virtually every other swing state.
That Biden has been able to hold on to a sizable level of support from this voting bloc — despite their overall migration to the GOP — shows the uniqueness of the president's electoral coalition in Wisconsin.
And it's a coalition that could help send him back to the White House, especially if he's also able to capture Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nebraska's Omaha-anchored 2nd Congressional District — in addition to the core of blue states that are the foundation of any Democratic presidential victory.
""In order to win, Democrats have to overperform — by a lot — with white working-class voters in the state, because most voters in Wisconsin are white working-class voters,"" Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler recently told The Washington Post. ""No one who's active in politics forgets that for a second.""

Supreme court ruling delays climate litigation big oil has sought to thwart,https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-ruling-delays-climate-165913264.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",10:29 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"The supreme court on Monday asked the Biden administration to weigh in on big oil’s request to thwart litigation that could put them on the hook for billions of dollars.
The one-line order will delay the litigation from advancing to trial. It follows an unprecedented pressure campaign from far-right fossil fuel allies on the court.
“Big oil companies are fighting desperately to avoid trial in lawsuits like Honolulu’s, which would expose the evidence of the fossil fuel industry’s climate lies for the entire world to see,” said Richard Wiles, president of the non-profit Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate accountability litigation.
Honolulu is one of dozens of cities and states to sue oil majors for allegedly hiding the dangers of their products from the public. In October, Hawaii’s supreme court ruled that the suit can go to trial.
But the defendants petitioned the US supreme court in February to review that decision, arguing the cases should be thrown out because emissions are a federal issue that cannot be tried in state courts.
The high court receives thousands of petitions each year, giving each one only a small chance of being reviewed. But in recent weeks, rightwing fossil fuel allies have pushed the justices to take up oil companies’ request, publishing a slew of op-eds and social media advertisements.
Some of the groups behind the pressure campaign – which experts say is unprecedented – are connected to far-right supreme court architect Leonard Leo, who co-chairs the ultraconservative legal advocacy group the Federalist Society.
“I have never, ever seen this kind of overt political campaign to influence the court like this,” said Patrick Parenteau, professor and senior climate policy fellow at Vermont Law School, told the Guardian last week.
It is not clear how much Monday’s order will delay the Honolulu case, which was filed in 2020. In October 2022, the supreme court referred a similar petition, involving a climate accountability case brought by Colorado communities, to the Department of Justice. The solicitor general weighed in the following March, siding with the plaintiffs.
While awaiting an opinion in the Honolulu case, companies may also file motions to stay – or pause – proceedings in similar litigation filed by other cities and states, though it is not clear the lower courts will grant them.
On the campaign trail, Biden promised to push his justice department to “strategically support” climate litigation. Advocates say Monday’s order will provide the Biden Department of Justice with an opportunity to make good on that promise.
The solicitor general, they say, should affirm the Hawaii supreme court’s earlier decision and call for the petition to be rejected.
The oil companies insist that only federal policy should handle the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. But the plaintiffs and their supporters say that the lawsuit is “not seeking to solve climate change or regulate emissions”, but rather aiming to force big oil to “stop lying and pay their fair share of the damages they knowingly caused”, said Alyssa Johl, vice-president of legal at the Center for Climate Integrity.
Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in the supreme court’s consideration of the petition, probably because he owned stock in ConocoPhillips, a defendant in the case.

Trump says he will meet probation officer before hush money sentencing,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-meet-probation-officer-165658506.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",10:26 PM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"By Luc Cohen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump said on Monday he would be interviewed by a probation officer ahead of his sentencing next month over his historic conviction on charges stemming from hush money paid to a porn star.
In a fundraising email to supporters, the Republican presidential candidate wrote, ""I'm actually about to speak to a probation officer after my RIGGED CONVICTION!"" Trump did not say when the meeting would take place.
In the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president, a Manhattan jury last month found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his former lawyer Michael Cohen's $130,000 payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says they had a decade earlier.
Trump denies the encounter and has vowed to appeal the verdict after his July 11 sentencing hearing before Justice Juan Merchan

. Trump has called the charges, brought by Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a partisan attempt to interfere with his campaign.
A probation officer's report is intended to give the sentencing judge a holistic view of a defendant's life circumstances and background to help decide whether a jail sentence or an alternative like probation is appropriate, said Duncan Levin, a New York defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor.
In a typical interview, the officer will ask defendants about their family, their childhood circumstances, their immigration status, and any drug use to compile a report to give judges context that may not have come out earlier in the case.
Such details are less relevant in this case because Trump's biographical details are already widely known, Levin said.
""The judge is already highly educated as to who this particular defendant is,"" Levin said.
The probation officer's recommendation is just one factor that judges consider in determining a sentence for criminal defendants. Prosecutors and defense lawyers also suggest sentences.
Merchan on Friday signed an order allowing Trump's defense lawyer Todd Blanche to be present during the interview. That is common, Levin said.
For defendants convicted of felony falsifying business records in the past, punishments like probation or fines are most common - but jail sentences are not unprecedented.
One factor that Merchan may consider is Trump's decision to take his case to trial. While any criminal defendant has the right to do so, judges often look favorably on people who admit culpability and express remorse.
Trump also faces three other criminal cases stemming from efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden and his handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases, none of which are likely to reach trial before the Nov. 5 election.

Supreme Court will take up Meta's bid to end lawsuit over Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal,https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-metas-bid-end-151420342.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",8:44 PM GMT+5:30,1 min read,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider shutting down a multibillion-dollar class action investors' lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.
The justices agreed to hear Meta's appeal of a lower-court ruling that allowed the class action to go forward. Investors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users' personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump’s successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.
Inadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company's shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.
The case will be argued in the fall.
Meta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.
Cambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Stephen Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.

Marjorie Taylor Greene compares Trump to Jesus at Las Vegas rally,https://www.yahoo.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-compares-trump-145827174.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",8:28 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"Donald Trump has been compared to Jesus Christ by the far-right Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene at a campaign rally for the former president in Las Vegas, a city more renowned for evoking images of gambling than biblical scenes.
Greene, who makes frequent references to her Christian faith, cited Trump’s supposed Christ-like qualities to challenge the Democrats’ efforts to capitalise on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s status as a convicted felon following his recent conviction in a case involving hush money paid to an adult film actor and falsified business records in a New York court.
“The Democrats and the fake news media want to constantly talk about ‘President Trump is a convicted felon’,” she told a crowd that waited in soaring early-summer temperatures. “Well, you want to know something? The man that I worship is also a convicted felon. And he was murdered on a Roman cross.”
In some parts of the political ecosphere, Greene’s comparison did not go over well.
“Did Jesus pay off a pornstar and cover it up,” read one comment on X left below a clip of Greene’s remarks on Sunday.
California’s Democratic congressman Adam Schiff sarcastically added: “Definitely not a cult.”
It is not the first time Greene has drawn parallels between Trump and Christ – whom Christians consider to be the messiah and son of God – as well as other historical martyr figures.
When he was arrested in New York on corruption charges in April last year, she likened Trump to Jesus and Nelson Mandela, who became South Africa’s first post-apartheid president after being jailed for 27 years by the racist regime.
“Trump is joining some of the most incredible people in history being arrested today. Nelson Mandela was arrested, served time in prison. Jesus was arrested and murdered by the Roman government,” she told the Right Side Broadcast Network.
“There have been many people throughout history that have been arrested and persecuted by radical, corrupt governments … I just can’t believe it’s happening, but I’ll always support him. He’s done nothing wrong.”
Comparisons with Christ have also been pushed by Trump himself as he has sought to exploit his popularity among white evangelical Christians – and despite apparently struggling to identify his favourite passage from the Bible.
When he went on trial in a civil case over business fraud last year, supporters circulated an image depicting him sitting in the courtroom alongside a Christ-like figure.
Trump, in turn, disseminated the faux sketch on his Truth Social site, writing: “This is the most accurate court sketch of all time. Because no one could have made it this far alone.”
He has pressed matters further in his fundraising appeals, invoking a metaphor of himself as a saviour in a headline on his campaign website reading: “They’re not after me. They’re after you. I’m just standing in the way.”
One of Trump’s celebrity supporters, the Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight, has also stressed the messianic theme, citing the Book of Joshua and the New Testament to assert that the ex-president “has been targeted for his information that can knock down the corrupt swamp”.
Voight added: “The one man that was ridiculed, destroyed as Jesus, Trump, can come back and save the American dream for all.”
Trump’s personal allusions to Christ are a marked contrast to the messaging of Joe Biden, who has frequently told voters to refrain from comparing Biden with the Almighty, but rather to compare him with the alternative in Trump.

Student-loan borrowers enrolled in Biden's new repayment plan may have gotten a win after a federal judge ruled only 3 states 'just barely' have standing to challenge the plan,https://www.yahoo.com/news/student-loan-borrowers-enrolled-bidens-143156202.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",8:01 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"Eleven GOP state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.
A district judge in Kansas ruled that only three of those states have standing to sue.
Even so, the judge said, their case is weak.
Student-loan borrowers enrolled in President Joe Biden's new repayment plan may have just gotten some relief from legal challenges.
In March, 11 GOP state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Kansas to block the SAVE income-driven repayment, arguing that the plan — which gives borrowers lower monthly payments and a shortened timeline to debt relief — goes against the Supreme Court's decision last summer to block Biden's broad debt cancellation plan.
The states requested that the court stop the SAVE plan's implementation. Kansas District Judge Daniel Crabtree issued his response on June 7, and he said that only three states — South Carolina, Texas, and Alaska — ""just barely"" have standing to prove the SAVE plan will reduce their states' revenues.
To prove standing, plaintiffs have to show that they'd be injured by the policy, that the injury can be directly traced back to the defendant, and that the relief they're seeking would address those injuries. Crabtree wrote that the three states' standing is ""weaker than the one that prevailed"" at the Supreme Court.
Crabtree also said that the other eight plaintiffs' argument that the SAVE plan's relief would undermine their recruiting efforts through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program has not, and will not, hold up in court.
""No court has ever bought into this theory, and this court declines to become the first,"" he wrote. ""These plaintiffs simply have no skin in the game. Their answer to Justice Scalia's colloquial expression of standing—What's it to you?—is this: It's nothing.""
Crabtree explained how this case is different from Biden v. Nebraska, the case brought before the Supreme Court. In Biden v. Nebraska, the plaintiffs argued that Biden's plan at the time to forgive up to $20,000 in student debt for borrowers making under $125,000 a year would harm student-loan company MOHELA because it would no longer be able to collect revenue from servicing forgiven loans.
In the case to block SAVE, the states are not arguing they would lose money from servicing loans. They're instead arguing that SAVE would cost them interest revenue because borrowers would have an incentive to consolidate privately held loans into direct loans, making the federal government their sole lender.
Biden's student-debt relief efforts are no stranger to legal challenges. In April, another seven GOP attorneys general filed a separate lawsuit to block SAVE, and in October, the New Civil Liberties Alliance filed a lawsuit on behalf of conservative groups the Cato Institue and Mackinac Center for Public Policy to block the Education Department's one-time account adjustments.
With regards to the latter case, the Sixth Circuit in May rejected the groups' appeal to block the account adjustments because their argument that the relief would undermine PSLF recruiting was ""unconvincing and illogical.""
The Education Department has maintained that its relief efforts are in accordance with the law. It's also in the process of implementing a broader student-loan forgiveness plan to replace the one the Supreme Court struck down, which is also likely to result in lawsuits.

"Biden supporters mostly back him in 2024 election because they oppose Trump, poll finds",https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-supporters-mostly-back-him-131032736.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",6:40 PM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"More than half of Joe Biden’s supporters are primarily motivated to cast their vote for the president in order to prevent a return of Donald Trump to the White House, according to a new poll.
Opposing Trump is the main reason to back Biden for 54% of the Democratic incumbent’s voters, the new CBS/YouGov poll found, up from 47% in a similar survey conducted in March, which was prior to the presumptive Republican nominee being found guilty of business fraud by a New York jury.
A further 27% of Biden voters are supporting the president because they like him – down from 31% in March – while 19% say that they are backing him because he is the Democratic nominee for president.
The poll comes as the Biden campaign has ramped up its rhetoric in attacking Trump directly in recent weeks, pointing to the former president’s felony conviction and string of past controversies. Last week, Biden said his predecessor is “reckless and dangerous” for complaining that his New York trial was rigged and claimed that he had been driven “crazy” by his 2020 election loss.
The outcome of this year’s presidential election remains in the balance, with the new CBS poll finding Biden and Trump are essentially tied nationally and in key swing states. Trump is on 50% of support among likely voters, and Biden is on 49%, with these figures switched for likely voters in battleground states.
Trump has enjoyed an edge over Biden in most polls taken in recent months, although there is some evidence of a slight shift towards the president in the wake of his predecessor’s felony conviction. Trump, who faces three other felony trials for hoarding classified documents and for trying to subvert the 2020 election, is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced in the New York case on 11 July.
However, the CBS poll found that 55% of likely voters say that Trump’s conviction is not a factor in their choice for president, with 28% saying it will be a major factor. While Trump has enjoyed a fundraising surge from supporters following the trial, the poll found that just 14% of his voters are backing him because of his conviction, with the vast majority saying it isn’t a factor for them.
Eight in 10 Trump voters believe, wrongly, that the former president was charged due to the actions of the Biden administration rather than local prosecutors, the poll found.
Overall, the main motivating issues for voters are the state of the US economy, inflation, the health of democracy and crime, according to the poll.

GOP hard-liners are pushing to oust House colleagues — and they have a new target,https://www.yahoo.com/news/gop-hard-liners-pushing-oust-130109595.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",6:31 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"Hard-right Republicans in Congress have so far failed to oust the handful of their GOP colleagues they’ve targeted in primaries this year. But the effort is moving forward, and Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina is next on their list.
It’s the latest incumbent primary in an ongoing proxy war for House GOP divisions over whether it’s best to work across the aisle and find some amount of common ground to pass legislation — or hold the conservative line at all costs, even if it means grinding Congress to a halt.
GOP Rep. Nancy Mace’s challenge in her primary has attracted more attention in South Carolina. But Timmons, a three-term congressman, is also facing a competitive primary Tuesday against state Rep. Adam Morgan, who's the leader of the Freedom Caucus in the South Carolina Legislature and has the support of several members of Congress.
For Timmons, this race is not about his conservative credentials.
“This isn’t a ‘Freedom Caucus versus William Timmons.’ This is a fringe, loud component of the Freedom Caucus,” Timmons said. “I have a more conservative voting record than six out of the nine people that have endorsed my primary opponent out of the Republican conference.”
“So it’s not about policy,” Timmons said. “It’s about tactics.”
Timmons does have some major advantages, including spending and support from outside groups and the most coveted endorsement in GOP politics: former President Donald Trump.
Yet he still could be vulnerable. Timmons narrowly avoided a runoff two years ago against lesser-funded opponents and then faced allegations of an extramarital affair. Timmons declined to comment on those allegations, but he has since divorced and told NBC News that he and his ex-wife are “still on very good terms.” South Carolina Republican strategists say the allegations could still be a problem for Timmons in the socially conservative district.
Proxy fight
GOP lawmakers on both sides of their internal fight over tactics have grown more willing to publicly back primary challengers against their own colleagues, including Timmons.
Morgan has endorsements from Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and members of the House Freedom Caucus, including Chairman Bob Good, R-Va., and Rep. Ralph Norman, Timmons’ South Carolina colleague. Timmons also boasts support from several Freedom Caucus members, including Reps. Byron Donalds of Florida and Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the founding members, as well as GOP Gov. Henry McMaster.
Gaetz campaigned with Morgan in April after sharing a video of him railing against special interests on the state House floor, helping to draw attention and money to Morgan’s campaign.

— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) March 10, 2024
“I need backup like him in Congress in order to save this country and defeat the establishment,” Gaetz said in a statement.
Gaetz, Good and some Freedom Caucus members have also backed primary challengers against Reps. Mike Bost of Illinois, Tony Gonzales of Texas and Don Bacon of Nebraska. Those incumbents prevailed, but Morgan thinks this race will be different.
“If you see the energy on the ground, people are ready for a change,” Morgan said in an interview. “And I think that it would probably be a very different race than some of the others. In our area, we have a very informed voter base that have already soured to our incumbent and they’re really ready for a strong alternative.”
Morgan said Timmons’ vote for Kevin McCarthy for House speaker last year was “definitely a factor” in his decision to run, and he supported Freedom Caucus members’ push for House rules changes that weakened the central control of the speakership.
Morgan said some Freedom Caucus members told him Timmons pressured them to support McCarthy, suggesting they could lose committee assignments if they did not fall in line.
“Not only was my member missing in action, as is his usual M.O., but he was actually working for McCarthy, against conservatives,” Morgan said.
Timmons, a former member of the panel that doles out committee assignments, said it is “not true” that he threatened any lawmakers on behalf of leadership. He said he told some lawmakers that “merit, seniority and team player” mentality are factored into committee posts.
Morgan has sought to cast Timmons as “do-nothing moderate” who has not supported conservative policies like cutting government spending, opposing diversity initiatives and opposing aid to Ukraine. (Timmons counters that he did vote against the most recent Ukraine aid package.)
Timmons, meanwhile, has cast Morgan as too extreme and uncompromising. His closing attack has centered on Morgan’s support for an amendment that said a “pregnant woman who intentionally commits an abortion” could be penalized with up to two years in prison or fined up to $5,000. Timmons argued such positions are counterproductive for the anti-abortion rights movement and could ultimately help Democrats win in November.
”Protecting life is not a liability for Republicans,” Morgan countered. He dismissed the attack and argued that he has voted in other instances to exempt women from criminal prosecutions.
Morgan said the amendment was aimed at solving a “loophole” relating to “when women who perform abortions on themselves,” appearing to refer to women who have medication abortions, which account for the majority of abortions in South Carolina.
Morgan said he supported the amendment “because we want to actually protect lives.”
Trump factor
Tuesday’s race in the 4th District will also test the power of Trump’s endorsement in a competitive primary.
Trump carried the upstate district, which is home to scores of evangelical voters, by a whopping 32 points in 2020, the widest margin of South Carolina’s seven districts, per calculations from Daily Kos Elections. In this year’s presidential primary, Trump won the 4th District by 20 points, with 60% of the vote.
“There’s no question it helps him [Timmons] in a Republican primary,” said South Carolian GOP strategist Chip Felkel, who is not involved in the race, adding that it likely boosts Timmons in more rural parts of the district outside Greenville and Spartanburg.
Timmons launched a TV ad with Trump speaking directly to camera and calling Timmons “an America first patriot.”
“A lot of people want to support Trump,” Timmons said. “And if Trump says, ‘This is my guy, I need him to help me get our country back on track,’ that’s what they’re going to do. … He is supporting me because of my results and because we’re like-minded.”
The ad underscores Timmons’ sizable financial advantage in the race. His and allied outside groups, including one tied to the cryptocurrency industry, have spent $3.1 million on ads to Morgan’s $221,000, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.
But Morgan isn’t concerned that Trump’s endorsement will hurt his campaign.
“People in this district love the president, support the president, but they’re not just going to vote for their representative because somebody tells them to,” Morgan said. “They’re going to do the research themselves.”
It’s not unheard of for a Trump-backed incumbent to lose a primary to the likes of hard-line Republicans like Good and Rep. Lauren Boebert, who beat a sitting member in Colorado in 2020. But it is rare.
“Thus far it’s been swinging a miss in some states,” South Carolinian GOP strategist Dave Wilson said of the hard-liners’ primary efforts.
“There’s a possibility they actually may get a hit with Adam Morgan,” Wilson added. “But the curveball of Donald Trump, so to speak, may be enough to strike them out here as well.”

Liberal Judge Susan Crawford enters race for Wisconsin Supreme Court with majority at stake,https://www.yahoo.com/news/liberal-judge-susan-crawford-enters-130108689.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",6:31 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A liberal judge who previously represented Planned Parenthood in a case related to abortion access entered the race for Wisconsin Supreme Court on Monday, with majority control of the battleground state's highest court on the line.
Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford launched her campaign to succeed retiring liberal Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, citing her previous work for Planned Parenthood as the fight over a Wisconsin abortion ban is playing out in court.
Crawford joins conservative Waukesha County Circuit Judge Brad Schimel, a former Republican state attorney general who opposes abortion, as the only announced candidates. If more than two candidates get in the race, a Feb. 18 primary will take place. The winner in the April 1 election will be elected to a 10-year term.
Crawford, in a statement, framed the race as a battle for ideological control of the court.
“For the first time in years, we have a majority on the court focused on getting the facts right, following the law, and protecting our constitutional rights,” Crawford said. ""We can’t risk having that progress reversed.”
Crawford vowed “to protect the basic rights and freedoms of Wisconsinites under our constitution,” which she said were threatened ”by an all-out effort to politicize the court to drive a right-wing agenda.”
Crawford also pitched herself as tough-on-crime, highlighting her past work as an assistant attorney general. Past liberal candidates who have won election to the court have made similar arguments.
“I know we need Supreme Court justices who understand what it takes to keep communities safe, who are impartial and fair, who will use common sense, and who won’t politicize the constitution to undermine our most basic rights,” Crawford said.
Crawford's campaign announcement also took a swipe at Schimel, labeling him a “right-wing extremist” because of his support for enforcing Wisconsin's 1849 abortion ban. That ban is on hold while two challenges to the 175-year-old state law are pending before the state Supreme Court.
Schimel accused Crawford of being “handpicked by the leftist majority on the Supreme Court to cement their stranglehold for another three years.”
“I’ve spent my career defending and upholding Wisconsin law and she’s spent much of hers suing the State of Wisconsin,” Schimel said in a statement. ""While I was a frontline prosecutor in the courtroom defending crime victims and putting criminals behind bars, she was working for radical left-wing special interests groups that don’t share our values.”
The April 1 election will determine who replaces Bradley, who is part of the 4-3 liberal majority and the longest-serving justice on the court. The election will also determine whether liberals will maintain majority control until at least 2028, the next time a liberal justice is up for election.
Crawford was elected as a judge in 2018 and won reelection to a second term in April. She started her career as a prosecutor for the state attorney general's office and worked as chief legal counsel to former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. As a private practice attorney, she fought Republican laws that limited access to abortion, effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers and required photo ID to vote.
Liberals took majority control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in August 2023 thanks to Janet Protasiewicz’s victory, flipping the court after 15 years of conservative control.
The court has made several key rulings since, including a December decision overturning Republican-drawn maps of the state’s legislative districts. Abortion was also a key issue in Protasiewicz's race.

US and Filipino forces end drills that tested their endurance in brutal heat and volatile weather,https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-filipino-forces-end-war-125525046.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",6:25 PM GMT+5:30,4 min read,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Hundreds of American and Filipino troops concluded Monday a new combat exercise in the northern Philippines that tested their endurance in more than a week of brutal heat and volatile weather, and braced them to respond to any threat in tropical jungles and on scattered islands, two U.S. and Philippine generals said.
The Biden administration has been strengthening an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any possible confrontation over Taiwan and other Asian flash points. The move has dovetailed with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defenses amid escalating disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.
The large-scale battle drills, which have been held in Hawaii in recent years under the U.S. Army’s Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center, have been introduced in the Philippines this year. There is also a version in Alaska. The exercises allow the U.S. Army, its allies and friendly forces to train in extreme conditions “where they are most likely to operate from archipelagos, jungles and heat in the tropics to high-altitude and extreme cold in the Arctic,” said Maj. Adan Cazarez, a public affairs officer of the U.S. Army’s 25th Infantry Division.
The June 1-10 warfighting exercise began with an air assault on mock enemy forces to allow the deployment of U.S. and Filipino soldiers who secured an area, which served as a staging ground before a major offensive. When their communication lines for supplies were threatened, top commanders decided to shift to a defensive assault and repelled the enemy attempt and successfully launched the offensive.
Key aspects of the mock battle, including the planning, deployments, logistical preparations and contingency readiness, were reviewed by military assessors for combat efficiency.
The combat exercises, Cazarez said, were integrated in annual U.S.-Philippine army joint exercises called Salaknib for the first time this year. About 1,500 U.S. and Filipino soldiers participated in the new battle drills staged in a hinterland in Fort Magsaysay, a sprawling Philippine army camp in an agricultural region known for its scorching weather. The temperature this year had been exacerbated by the El Nino, an occasional warming of the Pacific that shifts global weather patterns.
""The terrain is without question some of the most difficult that our soldiers have ever had the experience to move into. The heat on a daily basis was well over 95 degrees (Fahrenheit; 35 degrees Celsius) and it challenged us from a sustainable perspective,” Maj Gen. Marcus Evans, commander of the U.S. Army’s Hawaii-based 25th Infantry Division, told The Associated Press in an online interview from the battle training site.
Coordinating artillery and aerial fire and maneuvers “on a very challenging piece of terrain and, really, unforgiving temperatures, were all things that added to the overall training value,” Evans said. He added that American pilots also had to adjust to the region’s unpredictable weather.
Philippine army Maj. Gen. Andrew de Lara Costelo said the combat drills were designed to allow U.S. and Philippine forces and potentially other allies to operate seamlessly in future contingencies.
“This fosters interoperability and shared tactics, techniques and procedures,” Costelo told the AP.
“By working together, we harness our combined strengths, knowledge and capabilities, ensuring that we are prepared to face any challenges that may arise,” he said.
The war exercises were staged after the conclusion of two larger back-to-back exercises earlier this year between U.S. and Philippine forces, the Salaknib and the Balikatan — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — which involved more than 16,000 U.S. and Philippine military personnel in their largest combat maneuvers that involved live-fire drills in and near the disputed South China Sea. Several countries sent military observers.
China has vehemently opposed the combat exercises and increased deployments of American forces to Asia, including in the Philippines, saying such military presence was endangering regional stability and was designed to contain Beijing. The Philippine military says the military drills didn't target any country and served to deter aggression.
Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. defended his decision to allow a U.S. military presence in more Philippine military camps under a 2014 defense pact, saying it was vital to his country’s territorial defense.
China had warned that the increased U.S. military presence would “drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife.”

Hunter Biden’s Lawyers Are Expected to Rest Their Case in Gun Trial,https://www.yahoo.com/news/hunter-biden-lawyers-expected-rest-114627040.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",5:16 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"Hunter Biden

’s defense team is expected to wrap up arguments in his federal firearms trial in Delaware on Monday, and the jury could begin deliberating by day’s end barring any dramatic moves — like a last-minute decision by Biden to testify on his own behalf.
Biden, who is President Joe Biden’s son, was angered by the government’s tough cross-examination of his daughter Naomi Biden Neal on Friday and told people in his orbit that he would consider testifying. But the defense, after a weekend of consultations between Biden and his lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell, now seems more likely to rest without taking the risky step of putting Biden on the stand.
Prosecutors and Lowell’s team will meet early Monday with the presiding judge to consider a request by the defense to dismiss the case.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
If the judge, Maryellen Noreika, rejects Lowell’s motions, as expected, each side will present its closing argument and Noreika will issue instructions to the jury.
The government has sought to show that Biden regularly used drugs in 2018 and 2019 and that he falsely claimed to be drug-free when he filled out a federal firearms form. His lawyers have offered a spirited, if narrower, defense centered on whether Biden was actually doing crack cocaine at the time he bought the gun in October 2018 and have sought to undercut the prosecution’s witnesses by challenging their recollections.
Over two days, David C. Weiss, the special counsel in the case, summoned three of Biden’s former romantic partners, all of whom described in painful detail Biden’s unrelenting descent into crack addiction after his brother died of brain cancer. They included his former wife, Kathleen Buhle; a onetime girlfriend, Zoe Kestan; and Hallie Biden, his brother’s widow with whom he had an ill-fated romantic relationship.
Biden Neal has thus far been the only woman called by the defense.
In emotionally raw testimony, she gave an upbeat assessment of his drug use in the weeks before he bought the gun, saying he seemed “hopeful” and sober.
But under cross-examination, that claim seemed to crumble, with prosecutors introducing text messages from that period that illustrated an anguished, and excruciating, relationship in which she informed her father he had driven her to the breaking point.
Still, Biden Neal could offer only limited insights into the actions of Biden, who was often absent from her life for months and erratic even when they were in the same city.
The prosecution, which rested Friday morning, has also pointed to hundreds of text messages and bank records, as well as to the defendant’s own words, to illustrate Biden’s unyielding drug addiction in the months before and after October 2018.
Over the last week, Lowell has established that no one saw Biden doing crack cocaine in the month he bought the gun. Biden Neal’s testimony did not change that.
But two text messages retrieved from Biden’s phone have hurt his defense from the start. One day after he purchased the gun, he sent a text saying he was meeting a dealer named Mookie. A day later, he followed up to say that he was sleeping on a car and smoking crack.
The apparent admission came to a head Friday as Lowell questioned the prosecution’s last witness, Joshua Romig, a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, who was asked to translate drug lingo introduced in the government’s case against Biden.
Lowell made the point that while the prosecution had spent days examining Biden’s communications from earlier in 2018 and 2019, showing pictures of him holding a crack pipe and texts about buying drugs, there was nothing comparable to show for October 2018.
“No reference of Chore Boy?” Lowell said to Romig, referring to terms related to crack use. “No mention of a ball?”
Romig responded, “With the exception of the October text that we talked about, where he said he was smoking crack.”

Trump to make taped remarks to a Christian group that calls for abortion to be 'eradicated entirely',https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-speak-christian-group-calls-043527970.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",9:25 PM GMT+5:30,5 min read,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Donald Trump on Monday will make a virtual appearance before a Christian group that calls for abortion to be “eradicated entirely,"" as the presumptive Republican nominee again takes on an issue that Democrats want to make a focus of this year's presidential election.
The former president pre-recorded a video that will be shown at an event hosted by The Danbury Institute, which is meeting in Indianapolis in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention. The Danbury Institute, an association of churches, Christians and organizations, says on its website that it believes “that the greatest atrocity facing our generation today is the practice of abortion” and it “must be ended.”
“We will not rest until it is eradicated entirely,” the group said.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of a federally guaranteed right to abortion — having nominated three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade — but has resisted supporting a national abortion ban and says he wants to leave the issue to the states.
Though the Danbury Institute advertised Trump as a virtual speaker at the event, his campaign clarified Monday that Trump had pre-taped a brief video. In a transcript of his remarks provided by the campaign, Trump thanks the audience for their “tremendous devotion to God and Country.”
“These are difficult times for our nation, and your work is so important. We can’t afford to have anyone sit on the sidelines—now is the time for us all to pull together and stand up for our values and our freedoms,” Trump said, according to the transcript. “We have to defend religious liberty, free speech, innocent life, and the heritage and traditions that built America into the greatest nation in the history of the world. I know that each of you is protecting those values every day—and I hope we’ll be defending them side by side for the next four years.”
Both the Southern Baptists who will hear Trump on Monday and Republicans at large are split on abortion politics, with some calling for immediate, complete abortion bans and others more open to incremental tactics. Polls over the last several years have found a majority of Americans support some access to abortion, and abortion-rights groups have won several statewide votes since Roe was overturned, including in conservative-led states like Kansas and Ohio.
Like the GOP, the Southern Baptist Convention has moved steadily to the right since the 1980s, and its members were in the vanguard of the wider religious movement that strongly supported Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Trump. The Conservative Baptist Network, one of the event’s sponsors, wants to move the conservative denomination even further to the right.
Although they criticized President Bill Clinton’s sexual behavior in the 1990s, Southern Baptists and other evangelicals have supported Trump. That has continued despite allegations of sexual misconduct, multiple divorces and now his conviction on 34 charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn actor who said the two had sex. Trump will give his address on the same day he appears virtually for a required pre-sentencing interview with New York probation officers.
Many Southern Baptists say they see him as the only alternative to a Democratic agenda they abhor.
H. Sharayah Colter, spokesperson for The Danbury Institute, said in a statement that the presidential race was a “binary choice” and said Trump has “demonstrated a willingness to protect the value of life even when politically unpopular.”
And Albert Mohler, longtime president of the denomination’s flagship seminary and once an outspoken Clinton critic, wrote a column after Trump's conviction attacking Democrats for supporting transgender rights.
“Say what you will about Donald Trump and his sex scandals, he doesn’t confuse male and female,” wrote Mohler, who is a listed speaker for Monday's event, along with others from the denomination's right flank.
Trump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban and in an interview on the Fox News Channel last week, when commenting on the way some states are enshrining abortion rights and others are restricting them, said that “the people are deciding and in many ways, it’s a beautiful thing to watch.”
For over a year until he announced his position this spring, Trump had backed away from endorsing any specific national limit on abortion, unlike many other Republicans who eventually ended their presidential campaigns. Trump has repeatedly said the issue can be politically tricky and suggested he would “negotiate” a policy that would include exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.
Democrats and President Joe Biden’s campaign have tried to tie Trump to the most conservative state-level bans on abortion as well as a recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that would have restricted access to in vitro fertilization and other fertility procedures that are broadly popular.
“Four more years of Donald Trump means empowering organizations like the Danbury Institute who want to ban abortion nationally and punish women who have abortions,” said Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for Biden’s campaign. “Trump brags that he is responsible for overturning Roe, he thinks the extreme state bans happening now because of him are ‘working very brilliantly,’ and if he’s given the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban. These are the stakes this November.”
When asked about his appearance before the Danbury Institute, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Trump “has been very clear: he supports the rights of states to determine the laws on this issue and supports the three exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.”
Leavitt also said, “President Trump is committed to addressing groups with diverse opinions on all of the issues, as evidenced by his recent speech at the Libertarian Convention, his meetings with the unions, and his efforts to campaign in diverse neighborhoods across the country.”

Prosecutor says 'no one is above the law' as he urges jurors to convict Hunter Biden in gun case,https://www.yahoo.com/news/hunter-bidens-gun-trial-enters-042052071.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",10:43 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — A prosecutor said Monday that “no one is above the law” as he urged jurors to convict President Joe Biden

's son Hunter on charges that he lied about his drug use when he bought a gun in 2018.
The evidence is “overwhelming” that Hunter Biden knew he was in the throes of a crack addiction when he marked on a mandatory gun-purchase form that he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs, prosecutor Leo Wise told jurors in his closing argument.
The prosecutor acknowledged the intensely personal evidence that laid bare some of the darkest moments of Hunter Biden’s drug-fueled past. That included emotional testimony from his former romantic partners, personal text messages and photos of him holding a crack pipe and partly clothed.
“The evidence was personal. It was ugly, and it was overwhelming,” Wise said. “It was also absolutely necessary.”
Wise pointed to text messages that the prosecutor said showed Hunter trying to make drug deals on the day before the gun purchase and the day after.
“He knew he was using drugs. That’s what the evidence shows. And he knew he was addicted to drugs. That’s what the evidence shows,"" the prosecutor said.
Earlier, Hunter Biden smiled as he chatted with members of his defense team and flashed a thumbs-up to one of his supporters in the gallery after the final witness — an FBI agent called by prosecutors in their rebuttal case.
Several family members — including first lady Jill Biden and the president's brother James — sat in the first row of the Wilmington, Delaware, courtroom. At one point, Hunter Biden leaned over a railing to whisper in his mother's ear. She has sat through most of the trial, missing only one day last week to attend D-Day anniversary events with the president in France.
Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges stemming from the October 2018 purchase of a gun he had for about 11 days. He has accused the Justice Department of bending to political pressure from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans to bring the gun case and separate tax charges after a deal with prosecutors fell apart last year.
Hunter Biden's lawyers last week called three witnesses — including his daughter Naomi — as they tried to show that he did not consider himself an “addict” when he filled out the form.
Both Hunter and the prosecutors scanned the jury as U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika instructed them on the law. Some jurors took notes with yellow pencils, and many followed along with the judge’s instructions, turning pages as she read aloud from the bench.
The case has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015.
Hunter Biden's struggles with addiction before getting sober more than five years ago are well documented. But defense lawyers argue there's no evidence he was actually using drugs in the 11 days that he possessed the gun. He had completed a rehab program weeks earlier.
Jurors have heard emotional testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners and read personal text messages. They've seen photos of him holding a crack pipe and partly clothed, and video from his phone of crack cocaine weighed on a scale.
His ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel.
Jurors have heard him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts played in court of his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things."" The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn’t mention it specifically.
A key witness for prosecutors was Beau's widow, Hallie, who had a brief, troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother died of brain cancer. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter’s truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in Wilmington, where a man inadvertently fished it out of the trash.
From the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using drugs, Hallie told jurors. That time period included the day he bought the weapon. But jurors also saw text messages Hunter sent to Hallie in October 2018 saying he was waiting for a dealer and smoking crack. The first message was sent the day after he bought the gun. The second was sent the following day.
The defense has suggested Hunter Biden had been trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018.
“It was only after the gun was thrown away and the ensuing stress ... that the government was able to then find the same type of evidence of his use (e.g., photos, use of drug lingo) that he relapsed with drugs,"" defense lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court papers filed Friday.
Naomi Biden took the stand for the defense Friday, telling jurors about visiting her father while he was at a California rehab center weeks before he bought the gun. She told jurors that he seemed “hopeful” and to be improving, and she told him she was proud of him.
Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury’s verdict and has ruled out a presidential pardon for his son. After flying back from France, the president was at his home in Wilmington for the day and was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven leaders conference.
Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after the judge, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, raised concerns about it. Hunter Biden was subsequently indicted on three felony gun charges. He also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.
If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.

"Trump backs Sam Brown in US Senate race, widening momentum gap in crowded Nevada GOP field",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-backs-sam-brown-us-024900618.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",8:19 AM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — Former president Donald Trump endorsed Retired Army Capt. Sam Brown in the Nevada U.S. Senate race on Sunday, choosing a candidate widely seen as the front-runner over a crowded primary field of candidates who have angled to align themselves with the former president.
Trump’s endorsement came on Truth Social after he spent the day in Las Vegas holding a rally, where several of the GOP Senate candidates were in attendance. He said Brown was a “FEARLESS AMERICAN PATRIOT” and noted his Purple Heart status. He also said Brown will “fight tirelessly” for several of his priorities including border security and growing the economy.
The winner of Tuesday's Republican primary will face off with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, a first-term moderate who has become one of Republicans’ top targets in 2024.
Republicans view the Nevada race as a pivotal pickup opportunity that could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Democrats hold a 51-49 majority but are facing a challenging 2024 Senate map. They must defend incumbents not only in red states — Montana, Ohio and West Virginia — but also in multiple swing states including Nevada.
Trump chose Brown over several other candidates with close ties to the former president. One rival, Jeff Gunter, Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, has campaigned with the slogan that he is “110% pro-Trump” and has described Brown as the establishment pick for being endorsed by U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Jim Marchant, another candidate, ran as a Republican candidate for Nevada Secretary of State in 2022 on a platform of election denialism spurred by Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud. In 2022 he introduced Trump onstage when the former president visited Nevada to rally supporters for tight midterm elections.
The endorsement further lifts Brown above his opponents in terms of national backing. His opponents had long criticized Brown for skipping primary debates, a move that Trump also did when he polled well ahead of his opponents in the presidential primary.
Brown was a heavily recruited candidate for Republicans in Washington looking to avoid a repeat of their lackluster showing in the 2022 midterm elections, when flawed GOP candidates helped Democrats win battleground races and hold the Senate majority.
Brown made his military service central to his message this campaign cycle and in his unsuccessful 2022 Senate bid. He often told the story of the roadside bomb in Afghanistan that scarred his face and nearly killed him, as well as the leadership he learned while in the Army.
Following the endorsement Rosen called Brown her “extreme MAGA opponent” on X, and criticized him on issues including abortion, health care and social security.

"In visit to military cemetery in France, Biden attempts to draw contrast with Trump",https://www.yahoo.com/news/visit-military-cemetery-france-biden-231220742.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",4:42 AM GMT+5:30,4 min read,"PARIS — Not once in his trip to France did President Joe Biden speak Donald Trump’s name.
Standing near the gravesites of American soldiers killed in two world wars, Biden shied from overt references to his Republican rival or the presidential campaign back home.
Yet in some sense, Trump figured in virtually all of Biden’s remarks during his five-day visit. At every turn, Biden implicitly denounced Trump’s quasi-isolationist foreign policy outlook as the antithesis of what’s needed to fend off autocratic leaders that threaten democratic states.
The trip culminated in Biden’s visit Sunday to a military cemetery that is rich in political symbolism. Located about an hour from Paris, Aisne-Marne American cemetery is the burial ground for 2,289 Americans who died in World War I.
Trump avoided the cemetery when he was in France six years ago to mark the 100th anniversary of the war. His aides have cited weather conditions as the reason he didn’t show.
But John Kelly, who was Trump’s longest-serving White House chief of staff, has since given a statement confirming a report in The Atlantic in 2020 that Trump called the war dead “losers” and didn’t want to visit the burial ground.
(Trump has denied making the comment. Chris LaCivita, Trump’s 2024 co-campaign manager called the report “fake and thoroughly debunked,” while adding, “The fact remains that severe weather conditions on that day prevented the safe transportation of the president and guests to the cemetery, and he participated in a ceremony at the Suresnes American Cemetery the next day.”)
The American Battle Monuments Commission runs 12 different cemeteries in France, according to its website. Why did Biden choose the very one that Trump skipped?
He told reporters that it was because of the extraordinary number of Marines who died there in World War I. Yet there's also a political windfall that Biden's campaign has been looking to reap: his appearance can’t help but draw attention to Trump’s absence in 2018.
“The idea that I come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute —” Biden’s voice trailed off before finishing the thought.

A theme running through the trip was Biden’s celebration of America’s network of alliances. They helped the U.S. prevail in past wars and are needed today to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from defeating Ukraine and threatening the rest of Europe, he said.
At the cemetery, Biden said that “best way to avoid these kinds of battles in the future is to stay strong with our allies. Do not break. Do not break.”
Biden is betting that Americans prefer his foreign position to a more nationalist vision that Trump and many of his supporters have embraced.
As commander in chief, Trump faulted longtime allies for not ponying up enough money for defense and leaving it to the U.S. to provide a security umbrella.
He considered pulling out of the NATO alliance when he was in office, former aides said. And he doubled down on his position in February when he said he’d let Russia “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO allies that don’t spend enough money on their own defense.
The election may prove a referendum on which of the two approaches voters prefer. In his remarks to the press on Sunday, Biden seemed to take issue with the notion that Americans have become “semi-isolationist.""

“That’s not who we are,” he said. “It’s not who America is.”
The trip was largely a smooth one for the president. One of the few glitches wasn't of his making, a U.S. official said. There was about a 45-minute delay before the start of the ceremony on Thursday in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
Veterans in their 90s and 100s sat shivering in their wheelchairs in the afternoon chill as they waited for the event to begin. A U.S. official told NBC News the proceedings were delayed because French President Emmanuel Macron was late in arriving.
At a time when millions of voters believe that Biden, 81, is too old for the job, the trip was also fortuitous for him in that produced plenty of pictures showing him alongside WWII veterans old enough to be his father.
While exchanging toasts with Biden at the Elysee Palace on Saturday, Macron pointed to 100-year-old veteran Harold Terens, who was seated at a table with his fiancee, 96-year-old Jeanne Swerlin.
""They are with us today and they are just making their marriage vows,"" Macron said, through a translator. ""So, let us congratulate the young newlyweds.""
On Wednesday, Biden will leave for Europe again for the Group of Seven (G7) summit meeting in southern Italy.
Something else may be weighing on his mind, though. His son Hunter faces felony gun charges and his trial in Wilmington, Del. resumes on Monday. The prosecution has rested its case, and the president may soon learn whether his lone surviving son is found innocent or guilty.

"Bill would rename NYC subway stop after Stonewall, a landmark in LGBTQ+ rights movement",https://www.yahoo.com/news/bill-rename-nyc-subway-stop-212633594.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",7:28 AM GMT+5:30,1 min read,"NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City subway station would be renamed to commemorate the Stonewall riots that galvanized the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement, under legislation approved by state lawmakers as they wrapped up their session this month.
The state Legislature approved a bill Wednesday directing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to change the name of the Christopher Street-Sheridan Square subway station in Greenwich Village to the Christopher Street-Stonewall National Monument Station.
“This change will memorialize the history of the modern LGBTQ civil rights movement and inspire NY to demand justice and equality for all,” state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the proposal, wrote on the social platform X following the Senate’s passage of the measure.
The bill now heads to Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul for her approval. Her office said late Sunday it will review the legislation.
The Stonewall Inn was raided by police June 28, 1969, sparking a riot and several days of protests that marked a groundbreaking moment in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the country.
At the time, showing same-sex affection or dressing in a way deemed gender-inappropriate could get people arrested and led to bars that served them losing liquor licenses.
Today, Stonewall Inn is a National Historic Landmark, with patrons flocking to the site each June, when New York and many other cities hold LGBTQ+ pride celebrations.
The Stonewall National Monument Visitor Center is also planned to open next door as the National Park Service’s first such center focused on LGBTQ+ history.

Mexico ruling party wins lower house super-majority but falls short in Senate,https://www.yahoo.com/news/mexico-ruling-party-misses-senate-185335474.html,"Mon, June 10, 2024",12:23 AM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's ruling Morena party and its allies have won a super-majority in the lower house of Congress but not the Senate, the party's president said on Sunday, falling just short of the two-thirds majority needed in both houses to change the constitution.
Preliminary results from the June 2 vote, which elected Claudia Sheinbaum

as Mexico's first woman president in a landslide, had showed her party, Morena, and its allies coming close but missing out on the two-thirds majority.
Ultimately, Morena's coalition, which includes the Green Party and the Labor Party, will control 83 seats in the 128-seat Senate, just shy of the 85-seat super-majority threshold, Morena President Mario Delgado said in a social media post.
In the 500-member lower house of Congress, the ruling leftist coalition will have 372 seats, above the 334-seat super-majority threshold, Delgado said.
""With a super-majority in the lower house and a majority in the Senate, we will deepen the transformation to keep building a country with well-being and shared prosperity,"" Delgado said.
Mexico's INE electoral authority had said it would recount 60% of votes. Mexican opposition leader Xochitl Galvez, who lost to Sheinbaum in the election by some 30 percentage points, had called for a recount of 80% of the ballot boxes.
Uncertainty over the makeup of the next Congress, which takes office in September, roiled markets last week since both outgoing leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and President-elect Sheinbaum signaled their support for sweeping reforms to the constitution.
The potential reforms include the elimination of independent energy regulators, while consolidating power in the executive branch, in addition to an overhaul of the judiciary that would see popularly elected Supreme Court judges.

Republican challenger to Tester leans into his outsider status in Montana U.S. Senate debate,https://www.yahoo.com/news/republican-challenger-tester-leans-outsider-181709451.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",11:47 PM GMT+5:30,4 min read,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy embraced his status as an outsider who came to Montana to start a business as he sought on Sunday to fend off concerns over wealthy newcomers driving up property taxes during the first debate in a contest that could tip the balance of power in the Senate.
Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot and Sunday's debate was the first time the two candidates have confronted each other publicly. Republicans need to gain just a couple seats in the November election to retake the Senate majority.
Tester declared Sheehy “part of the problem” amid a housing shortage and rising taxes for many Montana residents after home values increased in many areas.
“We've had a lot of folks move into this state, a lot of folks with thick wallets, a lot of folks that drive up the cost of housing,"" Tester said. “Tim Sheehy is not part of the solution; he's part of the problem.”
Sheehy blamed Democrats for the increasing economic pressures faced by many households. The 37-year-old political newcomer and former Navy SEAL said Tester and President Joe Biden were not doing enough to rein in inflation.
He also said he'd been glad to move to Montana in 2014 to raise a family and start an aerial firefighting business near Bozeman.
“If you're not from here, Jon Tester doesn't think your voice matters, apparently,” Sheehy said. “Creating jobs in this state was an honor for me to do.”
The exchange reflected the central role that fiscal and economic issues could play as Republicans try to topple Tester, 67, a farmer and former state lawmaker from the small town of Big Sandy. He's seeking a fourth term in the Senate.
Many economic indicators remain positive in Montana and across the U.S., including growing job numbers and low unemployment. But ballooning property taxes along with rising costs for some goods and services are fueling political tensions with the potential to influence the election's outcome.
Tester is considered a moderate in Washington — a status that's helped him in the past to attract support from independent voters who make up a sizable portion of the Montana electorate. Yet Republicans have been on a roll during recent election cycles and now control every statewide office in Montana except for Tester's.
Sheehy has repeatedly tried to lump in Tester with President Joe Biden amid widespread public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to stem illegal immigration on the southern border. Biden last week announced tighter restrictions on asylum seekers entering the U.S.
“They're trying to fool us to say, 'We're going to solve it,'” Sheehy said. He derided as “political theater” an immigration bill from Democrats that was blocked by Republican lawmakers.
“It's time to shut it down,” he added about the border.
Tester acknowledged more needs to be done about immigration and said Biden's move on asylum should have been done earlier. He also emphasized his success in passing legislation to help veterans exposed to toxic burn pits work and to stimulate U.S. production of computer chips.
“I work across the aisle to get things done,” he said.
The candidates also clashed on abortion. Sheehy said he was against the medical procedure with exceptions to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest.
Tester countered that it should be up to women and their families “in consultation with her minister and her doctor.”
A proposed initiative that would add abortion rights to the state Constitution could further elevate the abortion issue in Montana if supporters gather enough signatures to get it on the ballot. The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 stripped away abortion protections at the national level.
Sheehy has invested more than $2 million of his own money into the campaign and received almost $11 million in donations. With a household net worth of between $72.9 million and $255.9 million, he has the ability to tap into far more.
Tester has reported raising $37 million. Outside groups have poured in tens of millions of dollars more on both sides.

"Biden administration ready for court challenges to border policy, Mayorkas says",https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-administration-ready-court-challenges-170044118.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",10:30 PM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"By Katharine Jackson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is prepared to defend in court the sweeping asylum policy put into place at the U.S.-Mexico border last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday.
Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday that generally bars migrants who illegally cross the southern border from claiming asylum and allows authorities to quickly deport or send migrants back to Mexico if the daily number of crossings exceeds 2,500. The asylum ban has exceptions for unaccompanied minors, people who face serious medical or safety threats, and victims of trafficking.
Mayorkas on Sunday said the administration was ready to defend the policy against an expected American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit.
""I respectfully disagree with the ACLU,"" Mayorkas said. ""We stand by the legality of what we have done. We stand by the value proposition. It's not only a matter of securing the border, we have a humanitarian obligation to keep vulnerable people out of the hands of exploitative smugglers.""
The ACLU confirmed on Sunday it plans to sue.
""It was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,"" ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project Deputy Director Lee Gelernt said in a statement.
Biden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Republican Donald Trump's restrictive policies but has grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the border illegally ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.
Mayorkas said initial indications showed the new policy was deterring some illegal immigration.
""It's early. The signs are positive,"" he said.
A U.S. border official told Reuters that authorities arrested around 3,100 people crossing illegally on Friday, down roughly 20% from the days before. The official requested anonymity to discuss preliminary figures.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who installed razor wire fencing along the Rio Grande and has seen a state law to enforce illegal crossings into his state blocked by a judge, told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" he thinks the policy is backfiring.
""All that this new Biden policy is going to do is to actually attract and invite even more people to cross the border illegally,"" Abbott said.

Jake Sullivan says U.S. aided Israel’s hostage rescue mission without sending troops on the ground,https://www.yahoo.com/news/jake-sullivan-israel-in-hostage-mission-us-troops-hamas-military-163226416.html,"Updated Sun, June 9, 2024",11:13 PM GMT+5:30,5 min read,"In a string of interviews that aired across major cable and broadcast networks Sunday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan urged both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to agree to President’s Joe Biden three-phase to end the war in Gaza.
Sullivan’s appearances — on ABC’s This Week, CBS’s Face the Nation and State of the Union on CNN — came the morning after an Israel Defense Force-led operation rescued four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza. The military operation reportedly resulted in 274 deaths while injuring an additional 698 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel's military spokesman Daniel Hagari, however, estimated there were fewer than 100 casualties.
Abu Obaida, spokesman for Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades military wing, claimed three hostages were killed in the attack, one of whom was a U.S. passport holder, reports USA Today. Israeli military spokesperson Peter Lerner, however, said any update from Hamas should be taken ""with a grain of salt.""
Saturday’s rescue mission was described by Reuters as “one of the single bloodiest Israeli assaults” since the Oct. 7 attacks, which left an estimated 1,200 dead in Israel.
The Associated Press reports that 36,379 Palestinians and Israelis have been killed in Gaza in the eight-month conflict, according to data from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. An additional 84,000 have been injured.
Here are some key takeaways from Sullivan’s back-to-back Sunday interviews.
The U.S. aided Israel in the hostage rescue mission — but had no forces on the ground.
Sullivan said the U.S. aided in the Saturday mission to rescue four Israeli hostages, all of whom were kidnapped during the Oct. 7 attacks, but offered few specific details about the U.S.’s involvement.
.@JakeSullivan46 confirms to @DanaBashCNN that “innocent people were tragically killed” during Israel’s hostage rescue operation and says that a ceasefire and hostage deal is the only way to prevent more loss of life.

“I can only just say that we have generally provided support to the [Israel Defense Force] so that we can try to get all of the hostages home, including the American hostages who are still being held,” he told State of the Union host Dana Bash. There are currently eight U.S. citizens being held hostage in Gaza.
While the U.S. had been working with Israel on the mission “for months,” Sullivan told This Week host Martha Raddatz that no U.S. troops were sent to participate in the operation.
“We didn’t have any U.S. forces on the ground,” he said.

Sullivan told Meet the Press host Margaret Brennan that neither Israel nor Hamas has agreed to Biden’s three-phase plan to end the war in Gaza. He hopes they will come to an agreement before Netanyahu addresses Congress on July 24 — putting the onus on Hamas to make the first move.
“The whole world is looking to Hamas to say yes,” he told Brennan, adding that the U.S. is in constant contact with Qatar and Egypt, who are acting as “mediators” between the U.S. and Hamas during ceasefire negotiations.
Hamas initially expressed a willingness to advance the ceasefire plan, while Netanyahu has said he would move forward only after Hamas is completely destroyed.
Hamas is making it ‘impossible’ to avoid civilian casualties
Sullivan said Hamas’s military tactics have placed innocent people in an “impossible situation,” making it difficult for Israel’s allies to advance rescue efforts without risking civilian lives.
“Hamas hides among the civilian population, holds hostages among the civilian population, fires at the IDF from behind the civilian population,” he told Raddatz on This Week.
Lerner, who also appeared on This Week Sunday, offered additional context on the degree to which Hamas compromises the lives of civilians — including hiding hostages in residential apartment buildings. He told Raddatz that Hamas attacked the IDF as they were attempting to extract the hostages on Saturday, which he said led Israel to respond with several airstrikes as self-defense, causing more casualties than previously anticipated.
“The tragedy of civilians being caught up in this is precisely because of how Hamas is battling us in the battleground,” Lerner said.

The U.S. supports Israel despite concerns over humanitarian crimes
Sullivan referenced the U.S. State Department’s latest report highlighting possible humanitarian crimes by Israel against Palestinians, telling Brennan there’s “enough information to have concern” about Israel’s military tactics.
Later, he told Raddatz that the U.S. stands on the side of Israel despite having made several warnings to Netanyahu that Israel should be taking “extra precautions” when it comes to protecting civilians.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan tells @MarthaRaddatz that it is “hard to say right now” how Israel's hostage rescue operation will impact cease-fire negotiations.

— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) June 9, 2024
“The U.S. will support Israel in taking steps to try and rescue hostages who are currently held by Hamas, and we will continue to work with Israel to do that,” Sullivan said, stressing the point that “Israel has the right to go after Hamas.”
“We have said all along that Israel should be operating in a way, not just consistent in the laws of war, but should take extra precautions to try to protect civilians,” he continued. “We see individual incidents where we’ve spoken out about where we would like to see them operate differently, where we would like them to be more precise, more targeted in their operations. And we will continue to speak out on those issues.”

Biden Loves to Tell Tall Tales. We Cut Them Down to Size.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-loves-tell-tall-tales-151253758.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",8:42 PM GMT+5:30,7 min read,"WASHINGTON — In President Joe Biden

’s telling, he was a teenage civil rights activist, a former trucker, the first in his family to go college and the nephew of a cannibalism victim.
All of these claims stretch the truth or are downright false. But Biden persists in telling personal tales with rhetorical flourishes and factual liberty when he works a room or regales an audience. They are a way to connect with voters, emphasize his “middle-class Joe” persona and charm his audience.
Despite Biden’s penchant for exaggerating details when recounting episodes from his life, these autobiographical embellishments differ in scale and significance from the stream of lies about a stolen election peddled by his opponent, former President Donald Trump.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
A White House spokesperson, Andrew Bates, said that Biden had “brought honesty and integrity back to the White House” and that he shared life experiences that had shaped his outlook.
Here are some of the president’s most repeated yarns.
Connecting With His Audience Through Hyperbole
What Was Said:
“In our last debate, when I was 29 years old, the first question he was asked at the debate was, ‘Do you have any regrets, Sen. Boggs?’ And he said, ‘No.’ Then we came to the very end of the debate, where I spoke and then he was to conclude. He stood up, and he said, ‘You know, I was asked if I had any regrets. I said no, but I have one: Had Joe Biden gone to the Naval Academy when I appointed him, he’d still have seven months left on and wouldn’t be able to run.’”
— in a May commencement speech at West Point Military Academy
Biden has repeatedly recounted this tale to graduating cadets at various military academies and to families of service members: In high school in the 1960s, he had been nominated to attend the U.S. Naval Academy by Sen. J. Caleb Boggs, R-Del., his opponent in his first Senate race. Boggs, Biden sometimes adds, later lamented that Biden had declined to accept the nomination in a 1972 debate. It is an anecdote that dates as far back as 2010, when Biden said in a speech that Boggs had “considered” him for the academy.
It is possible that this nomination occurred, but The New York Times could not verify Biden’s claim.
The academy does not have any records of Biden receiving a nomination or an appointment, said a spokesperson, Ashley Hockycko, but it does not possess preliminary applications or requests made to congressional offices.
Boggs started his first term as senator in January 1961. If the current deadline is any indication, members of Congress have until Jan. 31 to submit nominations to the Naval Academy. Biden graduated from high school that June and began his first semester at the University of Delaware that fall. The Delaware Historical Society, which houses Boggs’ Senate records, could find only his nominations to the Naval Academy from 1962. Biden’s name was not on that list.
Similarly, the Times was unable to verify Biden’s retelling of that 1972 debate. Newspaper articles detailing debates and events attended by Biden and Boggs in September and October of that year did not mention any questions about regrets or the nomination. In his 2007 autobiography, “Promises to Keep,” Biden wrote of only one debate, and did not include any reference to the nomination.
It is also unclear what Boggs, in Biden’s telling, could have meant by suggesting Biden would have still been committed to the academy or the armed services for another seven months. Cadets at the Naval Academy attend for four years and serve for at least five years in the Navy or Marines after graduation. Had Biden attended the academy instead of the University of Delaware in 1961, he would have still been able to run against Boggs in 1972.
What Was Said:
“I used to drive an 18-wheeler.”
— at an April campaign event in Florida
Biden often repeats this claim when attending events with union members. The White House cited Biden’s job driving a school bus during law school. In the 1970s, he also took a 500-mile trip as a senator on a cargo truck.
What Was Said:
“As a matter of fact, the first organization I ever joined was the NAACP. Didn’t get to vote until you were 21 in those days, but I got involved in civil rights when I was 15.”
— at an NAACP event in Michigan in May
“She said, ‘Remember when they were desegregating Lynnfield, the neighborhood? It was 70 homes, built, suburbia. And I told you there was a Black family moving in, and people were down there protesting. I told you not to go down there. And you went down, remember that? And you got arrested, standing on the porch with a Black family.’”
— in an interview with Howard Stern in April
For decades, Biden has occasionally suggested that he played a greater role in the civil rights movement than he actually did. Although there is corroboration of Biden’s participation in a few desegregation events, he has also said he would not consider himself an activist in the movement. There is no evidence that he was ever arrested.
The White House said that there are countless moments in any person’s life that local newspapers opt not to cover and that Biden was proud to have stood up against segregation in his youth.
The Washington Post detailed several other instances of the anecdote Biden is relaying, through his mother, of his arrest as a teenager while protesting for civil rights. In some cases, Biden has said he was 13 or that police brought him home.
Local newspapers reported that in the spring of 1959, when Biden was 16, a Black family moved into an all-white neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware, prompting residents to protest against integration. Police officers described the demonstrators as a mob, some armed with fire bombs, and arrested seven people, including four teenagers for possessing fireworks. (The house was bombed and destroyed later that year.)
Biden joined the NAACP during his first political race for New Castle County Council in 1970, when he was in his late 20s, according to a 2019 Post article that included an interview with the former president of the Delaware NAACP.
Highlighting and Exaggerating His Middle-Class Roots
What Was Said:
“I’m the first in my family ever to go to college.”
— at a May campaign event in Detroit
Biden described his maternal grandfather, Ambrose Finnegan Sr., as the “only person in the house with a college degree” in his 2007 autobiography. According to Finnegan’s 1957 obituary, he attended and played football for Santa Clara College in California. Biden has previously said that he was the first on the Biden side of the family to go to college.
What Was Said:
“Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny. I hope you’re all able to make $400,000. I never did.”
— at an April campaign event in Pennsylvania
“She said, ‘Did you read today’s paper?’ I said, ‘They don’t have today’s paper — Wilmington paper, Delaware — where I’m with [Sen. Patrick] Leahy up in Vermont. And she said, ‘Well, let me read it. Top of the fold, headline, Biden, poorest man in Congress.’”
— at a March campaign event in Nevada
For much of his political career, Biden was among the least wealthy members of Congress. With a net worth of negative $166,500, Biden was listed by the newspaper Roll Call as the poorest member in 1990, the first year it began compiling net worth rankings. (The News Journal, based in Wilmington, reported the ranking on Page 33, not the front page.)
He continued to rank near the bottom for net worth throughout his decades-long career in the Senate. According to Biden’s tax returns, he and his wife, Jill, earned less than $400,000 almost every year from 1998 to 2016. But they earned more than $400,000 in 2013 and in every year since 2017, ranging from $408,733 in 2013 to more than $11 million in 2017. (The president’s yearly salary, under federal law, is $400,000.)
Stories Too Good to Be True
What Was Said:
“Ambrose Finnegan — we called him Uncle Bosie — he was shot down. He was Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force. He flew single engine planes, reconnaissance flights over New Guinea. He had volunteered because someone couldn’t make it. He got shot down in an area where there were a lot of cannibals in New Guinea at the time.”
— in remarks to reporters in April
In his 2007 autobiography, Biden wrote that he often heard family lore about his hero uncle, Ambrose Finnegan Jr., who was a pilot during World War II. But his suggestion that Finnegan was shot down and cannibalized in New Guinea is not supported by military records or anthropologists.
According to the agency of the Pentagon that accounts for the missing or those taken prisoner during war, Finnegan, a second lieutenant, was a passenger on an aircraft that crashed into the ocean on the north coast of New Guinea in May 1944 after its engines failed. Three men, including Biden’s uncle, were lost in the crash while a fourth was rescued by a passing barge. There are no indications that the plane was shot down or that Finnegan was flying the plane.
Finnegan would have been an unlikely victim of cannibalism in New Guinea, anthropologists and locals told PolitiFact and The Guardian. Studies of cannibalism in the country have noted that victims tended to be enemies from warring tribes as an act of revenge or deceased relatives as part of a mourning ritual.
Biden shared his account of Finnegan’s death after visiting a war memorial in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that bore his uncle’s name. The story was meant to highlight Biden’s commitment to equipping troops and honoring veterans, the White House said.
What Was Said:
“I was getting on the train, and one of the senior guys at Amtrak — I became friends with all of them after all the years, and I’ve ridden 36 years as a senator — and he comes up to me — his name is Angelo — and he comes over and says, ‘Joey, baby!’ He grabs my cheek, and I thought they were going to shoot him. And I said, ‘Ang, what’s the matter?’ He said, ‘I just read in the newspaper’ — because they keep meticulous mileage about how many times you — how many miles you use an aircraft for the United States Air Force as vice president. ‘I just read in the paper, Joey, you traveled 1,200,000 miles on Air Force Two.’”
— in a speech in Nevada in December
This story, as told, stretches credulity. Biden logged 1.2 million miles on Air Force Two in early 2016, according to himself. Angelo Negri, the conductor, retired from Amtrak in 1993 and died in 2014. It is possible that Biden mistook another conductor for Negri: He recounted in 2009 speaking with an unnamed Amtrak employee, who also called out to him, “Joey, baby.”

Biden’s Border Crackdown Could Disproportionately Affect Families,https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-border-crackdown-could-disproportionately-142041450.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",7:50 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"A new border crackdown unveiled by the Biden

administration this week is likely to disproportionately affect families, whose soaring numbers in the last decade have drastically changed the profile of the population crossing the southern border.
Family units have come to represent a substantial share of border crossers, accounting for about 40% of all migrants who have entered the United States this year. Families generally have been released into the country quickly because of legal constraints that prevent children from being detained for extended periods.
They then join the millions of undocumented people who stay in the United States indefinitely, under the radar of U.S. authorities, as they wait for court dates years in the future.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
But according to a memo issued by the Homeland Security Department and obtained by The New York Times, families will be returned to their home countries within days under President Joe Biden’s new border policy, which temporarily closed the U.S.-Mexico border to most asylum-seekers as of 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.
The implications of the new policy are enormous for families, who are some of the most vulnerable groups making the journey to the United States. Advocates warn that it could have dangerous repercussions, making parents more likely to separate from their children or send them alone to the border, because unaccompanied minors are exempt from the new policy.
The vast majority of families seeking asylum are from Central America and Mexico, which places them in a category described in the memo as “easily removable,” akin to single adults from those regions. The memo lays out how authorities are to carry out the new policy.
Smuggling organizations had long used the likelihood that migrants would be released after entering the country unlawfully as a selling point. But the new border policy makes no distinction between how families and single adults who enter the country illegally are handled, erasing the perceived advantage of arriving as a family.
Instead, families would be prioritized for expedited removal, a Biden administration official said, asking for anonymity to discuss the executive action.
“This seems to be a remarkably cynical strategy to run up the numbers of deportees by targeting the most vulnerable segment of the migration flow,” said Wayne Cornelius, director emeritus of the Mexican Migration Field Research Program at the University of California San Diego.
But with the number of people crossing the border at record levels, the new policy was an attempt to cut down on illegal immigration and ameliorate one of Biden’s biggest vulnerabilities in his campaign against former President Donald Trump. Biden is under pressure, even from within his own party, to do something about immigration.
In a significant change that mimics a Trump-era practice, some families who argue that they should be an exception to the new asylum restrictions will have a so-called credible-fear interview during detention at the border, which is difficult to pass while in custody and without a lawyer.
“It is horrifying to hear that the Biden administration is quietly rolling out one of the absolutely worst Trump border pilot programs — subjecting families to rapid credible-fear interviews while detained in Border Patrol custody,” said Taylor Levy, an immigration lawyer.
The removal of families is made easier by the fact that most are from Guatemala, Honduras and other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Those countries are relatively close to the United States and already accept repatriations, unlike many countries in Africa and Asia, which are far away and whose governments are less likely to accept deportees.
Biden’s order, which went into effect Wednesday, empowers border agents to turn back — or swiftly deport — migrants who come into the country illegally, with few exceptions.
The border will reopen only when the number of unauthorized crossings drops to fewer than 1,500 for seven days in a row and stays that way for two weeks. The numbers have not been that low in years; in December, there were about 10,000 illegal crossings every day.
More recently, the figures have hovered around 3,000 crossings per day.
For decades, single adult men intent on working in the United States accounted for the overwhelming majority of migrants who arrived in the country. They left their wives and children behind and sent money home to support them.
Around 2013, whole families began migrating in sizable numbers from Central America, driven in large part by a surge in gang-related violence. The Obama administration struggled with the influx and deemed it an emergency.
The tide continued to swell and has not let up in more than a decade.
“Whole-family migration became increasingly important as a strategy for protecting children from cartel and gang-related violence,” Cornelius said.
With no immigration detention sites equipped for women with children and limits on how long children could be confined, the families were quickly released by the U.S. Border Patrol with an order to appear in court for deportation hearings. The families then traveled to join relatives living in the United States.
Most single adults continued to be detained for days or longer — and, often, to be processed for immediate deportation.
Migrants traveling as families sent word back home that they had been allowed to remain at least temporarily in the United States, spurring others to make the trek north.
Smugglers stoked rumors of special treatment for families to generate more business, as parents with children were less likely to attempt the perilous journey without a guide.
Soon, adult men seeking to work in the United States also began to cross the border with children, who they knew would enable them to stay in the country.
Families with children rapidly became a significant, fast-growing share of the migrant population. At the same time, apprehensions of single adults, as a share of the total, plummeted. Some years, their sheer numbers were dwarfed by those of people coming in families.
Between 2018 and 2019, for instance, the number of migrants in family units who crossed the border illegally jumped to 432,838 from 77,794, an increase of 456%. The number of apprehended migrants who were single adults climbed by 30%, to 258,375 from 198,492.
Last year, 621,311 family units were apprehended after crossing the southern border.
In recent years, Mexican families displaced by cartels that control swaths of territory have been crossing the border in ever-greater numbers to seek safety in the United States.
In the first eight months of the 2024 fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, the Border Patrol apprehended nearly 150,000 Mexican migrant families entering the United States illegally, compared with 87,014 in 2023 and 17,040 in 2020.
“Huge numbers of Mexican families have been coming, and they are easy to send back,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, because they can be returned to their country on a bus.
The removal of families, and the exemption for unaccompanied minors, under the new restrictions are almost certain to lead to family separations as desperate parents decide to send their children alone, often with smugglers, she said.
In May last year, a 4-year-old child was dropped into the United States over the steel wall that separates San Diego from the Mexican city of Tijuana. The child survived. Two years earlier, agents rescued two young sisters, 3 and 5, who had been dropped on the U.S. side of the barrier in New Mexico.

Why Robert F. Kennedy's Jr.'s current presidential polling numbers might not hold up into November,https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-robert-f-kennedys-jr-115853133.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",5:28 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reached 15% or more in three approved national polls. One more, and he will have met one of CNN's benchmarks to qualify for the debate June 27 with Democratic President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.
But Kennedy cannot count on maintaining his current level of support as the November election nears.
It is pretty common for third-party candidates to look like they have polling momentum in the months before an election, only to come up far short at the ballot box, according to an Associated Press analysis of Gallup data going back to 1980.
That is not a sign that the polls about Kennedy are wrong right now. They just are not predictors of what will happen in the general election.
Studies have shown that people are bad at predicting their future behavior, and voting is months away. And in a year with two highly unpopular candidates in a rematch from 2020, voters may also use their early support for a third-party candidate to express their frustration with the major party choices. In the end, voters may support the candidate for whom they feel their vote can make a difference or they may decide not to vote at all.
AMERICANS WANT A THIRD PARTY, IN THEORY
The concept of a third party has been popular for a long time.
A poll conducted by Gallup in 1999 found two-thirds of U.S. adults said they favored a third political party that would run candidates for president, Congress and state offices against Republicans and Democrats. (The AP analysis used Gallup data, when available, because Gallup has a long history of high-quality polling in the United States.)
About 6 in 10 U.S. adults have said in Gallup polling since 2013 that the Republican and Democratic parties do “such a poor job representing the American people” that a third major party is needed. In the latest Gallup polling, much of that enthusiasm is carried by independents: 75% say a third party is needed. About 6 in 10 Republicans and slightly fewer than half of Democrats (46%) say an alternative is necessary.
Marjorie Hershey, a professor emeritus in the political science department at Indiana University, said Americans generally like the idea of a third party until specifics emerge, such as that party's policies and nominees.
“It’s a symbolic notion. Do I want more choices? Well, sure. Everybody always wants more choices, more ice cream choices, more fast-food choices,” Hershey said. “But if you start to get down to brass tacks and you talk about, so would it be tacos or burgers, then that’s an entirely different choice, right?”
THIRD-PARTY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES RARELY GET A SUBSTANTIAL SHARE OF THE VOTE
That hypothetical support for third-party candidates often breaks down quickly.
The AP analysis looked at polling for every independent and minor party presidential candidate who received at least 3% of the popular vote nationally going back to the 1980 election.
In multiple elections, including the 1980, 1992, and 2016 presidential races, third-party candidates hit early polling numbers that were much higher than their ultimate vote share. For instance, in polls conducted in May and June 1980, between 21% and 24% of registered voters said they would like to see independent candidate John Anderson, a veteran Republican congressman from Illinois, win when he ran for president against Republican Ronald Reagan and Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter. Anderson went on to earn 7% of the popular vote.
Part of the problem is that early polls often look quite different from the actual general election vote.
Voters ""don’t know what’s going to happen between now and the election,” said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. “Things are going to come up in the campaign that could change the way they think.”
Decades after Anderson, polls conducted during the 2016 presidential campaign put support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, at between 5% and 12% in polls of registered voters conducted from May to July. That led some people to predict that he could do better than any third-party candidate in decades. Johnson won about 3% of the vote in that election.
Johnson told the AP that he believes his name should have been included in more polls, though he was in surveys used to determine eligibility for debates.
He also contends that independent candidates struggle to match major party candidates in fundraising.
“It’s money, first and foremost. People don’t donate if they don’t think that you have a possibility of winning,"" Johnson said. ""I’m not excluding myself from that same equation. Look, am I going to give money to somebody that I know is going to lose? I’d rather go on a vacation in Kauai,” Johnson said in an interview while driving with his family on a trip in Hawaii.
KENNEDY'S SUPPORT MAY DROP OFF AS THE ELECTION NEARS
The American electoral system makes it hard for third parties to thrive. Still, it is possible to have a significant impact without coming close to winning.
Billionaire businessman Ross Perot is among the most successful modern-day examples. He won 19% of the vote when he ran for president in 1992. But that was substantially lower than his support in earlier polling. In polls conducted from May to July of that year, between 30% and 39% of registered voters said they would vote for Perot.
There are already reasons to believe that at least some of Kennedy’s polling support may be a mirage. (The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)
A CNN poll conducted last summer when he was running for the Democratic nomination found that 2 in 10 Democrats who would consider supporting him said that their support was related to the Kennedy name or his family connections. An additional 17% said they did not know enough about him and wanted to learn more, while only 12% said it was because of support for his views and policies.
“A variable that is so different from all these other people is the Kennedy name,” said Barbara Perry, an expert in presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. “There’s a lot of emotion around him that I would say was not there in the Anderson, Perot, (Ralph) Nader and Johnson cases.”
There also is some evidence that Americans are using support for Kennedy to express frustration with Biden and Trump.
Hershey notes that for many people, presidential elections can feel abstract until a few weeks before it happens, so it is good to take early poll numbers with a grain of salt.
Such polls “don’t necessarily reflect actual political issues,” Hershey said. “They reflect general views about life.”

Hunter Biden's family weathers a public and expansive airing in federal court of his drug addiction,https://www.yahoo.com/news/hunter-bidens-family-weathers-public-115004955.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",5:20 PM GMT+5:30,7 min read,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — In a span of less than 48 hours this past week, first lady Jill Biden shuttled from a Normandy ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in France to the front row of a Delaware courtroom, where Hunter Biden is on trial in a gun case, and then back to Paris for an elaborate state visit at Élysée Palace.
“Here we are again,” the first lady said with a laugh as she and President Joe Biden

were greeted by French President Emanuel Macron and his wife, Brigette, at the palace on Saturday, the light comment an oblique nod to her transatlantic commute.
It was a manifestation of the great lengths to which the Biden family has gone to support Hunter Biden as he stands trial in Wilmington, Delaware, accused of lying on a federal gun purchase form when he said he did not have a drug problem. Jill Biden has been a regular presence in the courtroom, buttressed by a rotating cast of other family members.
“The back and forth, the push and pull, of family responsibilities, of first lady duties, of her career, of the campaign — that’s just who she is,” said Elizabeth Alexander, the first lady’s communications director.
Every family wrestles with personal challenges, and politicians are often left to navigate those dynamics in public. But the very expansive airing in court of tawdry details surrounding Hunter Biden’s addiction – in the glare of an election year -- is of an order of greater magnitude. And the president’s family has shown a determination to ensure Hunter Biden does not weather it alone.
The trial resumes Monday. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges, but he does not deny a drug problem. His memoir, “Beautiful Things,” is all about hitting bottom after his brother Beau’s death in 2015 from cancer. But his lawyers say he did not consider himself to be an “addict” at the time he filled out the gun purchase form in 2018 to buy a revolver.
BOTH PRESIDENT AND A DAD
Joe Biden has steered clear of the courtroom and said little about the case, wary of creating an impression of interfering in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. But the president has long walked the line between public servant and father.
At just 30, the Democrat was sworn in as Delaware's junior senator from a hospital room where his young sons were recuperating from a car accident that killed his wife and baby daughter.
In grainy black-and-white newsreels, Biden can been seen holding 3-year-old Hunter as the new senator takes the oath and 4-year-old Beau watches from a hospital bed. Joe Biden pledged then that if there was ever a conflict between “my being a good father and being a good senator,” he would resign.
The president did put out a brief written statement as Hunter Biden's trial began.
“As the president, I don’t and won’t comment on pending federal cases, but as a dad, I have boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength,” he said. “Our family has been through a lot together, and Jill and I are going to continue to be there for Hunter and our family with our love and support.”
The case followed him to Normandy nonetheless, where Biden was asked in an ABC interview whether he thought his son would get a fair trial and whether the president would rule out pardoning his son if there was a guilty verdict.
Biden answered with a terse “yes” on both matters.
SHOW OF SUPPORT
Over the trial’s first week, Jill Biden was in court four days out of five, missing only Thursday due to the D-Day events. Others who have taken seats in the courtroom at various points are Hunter’s sister Ashley, aunts Bonny Jacobs and Valerie Owens and his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden.
The first lady has leaned over the court railing to embrace Hunter, who has called her mom since she married Joe Biden in 1977. She has walked hand in hand with him out of the courtroom. She has listened to hours of testimony.
Hunter has not made it easy for his family, and the evidence in the case has been a highly personal tour of his mistakes and drug use, some kind of nightmare version of “This is Your Life.""
Jurors have listened to hours of testimony from his ex-wife, a former girlfriend and his brother's widow, who between them painted a picture of strip club trips, infidelity, habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. Jurors saw images of the president’s son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room and half-naked holding crack pipes. And they watched a video of his crack cocaine being weighed on a scale.
Federal prosecutors have argued the evidence was necessary to prove to jurors that Hunter Biden, 54, was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked “no” on the form that asked whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to” drugs.
On Friday, his eldest daughter, Naomi, 30, testified for the defense, telling jurors a hopeful story about how her father seemed to be getting better around the time of the gun purchase.
“I told him I was so proud of him,” she said softly.
But then prosecutor Leo Wise showed her texts that showed erratic behavior during that same period. Her father did not respond to her message for hours, then asked her at 2 a.m. whether her boyfriend could meet up to switch cars.
“Right now?” she responded. “I’m really sorry dad I can’t take this.”
When she got off the stand, she stopped at the defense table, pausing to hug her dad before she left the courtroom.
By Friday afternoon, the first lady was headed back to France for the state dinner.
Her transcontinental flights underscore the importance of family to the Bidens writ large, said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, an expert on first ladies and author of “Camera Girl,” about Jacqueline Kennedy.
“She understands that at the end of the day what matters is her son and his well-being and knowing he has support and knowing, also, the vulnerability of someone who has been in recovery,” Anthony said.
A FAMILIAR STORY
Patrick Kennedy, a former congressman and leading voice on mental health and addiction, said Hunter Biden's story is so common that he expected many Americans would see something familiar in it, however disturbing or embarrassing it seems. Kennedy himself struggled with drug addiction and is the son of a famous lawmaker, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
“The disease of addiction seems to be what is on trial here,"" he said, arguing that a big part of the case is the definition of sobriety. Are you sober when you are not taking drugs? Or are you sober when there has been a profound shift in your thinking that goes along with stopping the drugs?
“Half say it’s physical, and the other half say it’s mental — and truth is that it is both,"" he said.
WHAT COMES NEXT
The trial is winding down. The defense is debating whether to call more witnesses on Monday, including the president’s brother James. After closing arguments, the case will go to the jury.
But Hunter Biden’s legal problems will not end there. He faces a separate trial in September in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes.
A plea deal had been negotiated last summer that would have resolved both the gun and tax matters, avoiding the spectacle of a trial so close to the presidential election this November. But when U.S. District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated by former President Donald Trump, questioned aspects of the deal, the lawyers could not come to a resolution. The deal fell apart.
Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the lead investigator, former U.S. Attorney David Weiss of Delaware, as a special counsel in August. A month later, Hunter Biden was indicted.
Hunter Biden has argued he is being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president’s son.

The Trump-Biden rematch has incredibly high stakes. Here's why some Americans might not vote anyway.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-biden-rematch-incredibly-high-113901178.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",5:09 PM GMT+5:30,3 min read,"Trump and Biden

are set for a rematch this fall, and the stakes couldn't be higher.
Yet some voters are likely to sit out the election for a variety of reasons.
They include anger over the war in Gaza and an unhappiness with both choices.
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are set for a rematch this November — and most Americans aren't happy about it.
An April survey from the Pew Research Center found that 49% of voters would replace both candidates if they could. Poll after poll has shown that the race is essentially tied at the national level.
The stakes of the election couldn't be higher. Voters face a choice between a continuation of the status quo — and perhaps a more aggressive slate of progressive reforms, if Democrats regain control of both chambers of Congress — and a radically different vision for America that could bring mass deportations and fewer restraints on executive power. Some believe that American democracy itself is at stake.
Yet plenty of voters are likely to choose neither candidate in November, either casting protest votes for third-party candidates or staying out home altogether.
Voter apathy and non-voting are very common
We've never had an election where voter turnout is 100%.
In the last six elections since 2000, between one-third to one-half of eligible voters have failed to cast ballots, either because they chose not to do so, forgot to do so, or were prevented from doing so for some other reason.
It's difficult to make generalizations around why some Americans don't vote, but there are some broad theories that could apply. One theory posited by the 2017 book ""The American Nonvoter"" is that a sense of uncertainty, especially driven by a national crisis such as a pandemic, plays a key role in motivating less engaged people to vote.
This year's election presents a scenario that's relatively rare: Both Biden and Trump have been president, they have both been fairly unpopular, and everyone knows who they are.
More importantly, almost every voter — aside from the most recent immigrants — has a sense of what life in America is like when one or the other is in office.
While a Trump versus Biden presidency has massive implications writ large, some Americans may not feel especially impacted in their day-to-day lives by who sits in the Oval Office.
Some are intentionally sitting out over the war in Gaza
Aside from pre-existing reasons of voter apathy, some voters are intentionally planning to stay home out of protest.
The single biggest driver of such protests this year are left-wing voters who would otherwise support President Joe Biden but wish to protest his support for Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed over 35,0000 people and led to dire humanitarian conditions.
In the Democratic presidential primaries this year, hundreds of thousands of voters have cast ""uncommitted"" ballots to signal their displeasure.
Depending on whether a cease-fire agreement is reached before the election, those voters could sit out November, at least at the presidential level. And more radical groups like ""Abandon Biden"" are already pushing for voters to do that, regardless of what happens between now and then.
These voters, many of whom are Arab or Muslim Americans, say that they know what a Trump victory would mean for them. The former president has long made Muslims a scapegoat for his brand of politics, and he has vaguely pledged to expand upon the so-called ""Muslim ban"" that he enacted when he was president.
Yet they're preparing to stay home anyway, arguing — in the words of Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud — that ""a genocide outweighs all of this.""

A Trump hush-money prosecutor said Melania was pregnant during one of Trump's affairs. That timeline doesn't add up.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-hush-money-prosecutor-said-100402883.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",3:34 PM GMT+5:30,8 min read,"A prosecutor in Donald Trump's criminal case said Melania was pregnant during his affair with Karen McDougal.
The affair actually began after Melania gave birth to Barron, two sources told Business Insider.
The timeline discrepancy was left a lingering mystery after the trial ended last month.
Donald Trump's criminal hush-money trial has given the public more details than anyone wanted about the former president's sex life. But, after weeks of testimony, one mystery lingered.
According to one of the prosecutors in the case, Trump had an affair with Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, while his wife, Melania Trump, was pregnant.
The claim that McDougal and Trump had an affair was not new. The idea that the affair took place while Melania Trump was expecting a child, however, had never been previously reported. The prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass, disclosed it at a hearing just before jury selection began, on the morning of April 15.
And it was that detail that would bolster the prosecution's argument that Trump silenced women to benefit his 2016 presidential campaign, he said.
""The fact that this relationship occurred during the defendant's wife's pregnancy, and after the birth of their child, speaks directly to the extent to which the defendant believed the story would be damaging to his campaign,"" Steinglass told the judge.
According to two sources with knowledge of McDougal's relationship with Trump, the prosecutor got the detail wrong.
""We were just as surprised as you when Josh Steinglass stated that Melania was pregnant at the time,"" Carol Heller, a representative for McDougal, told Business Insider.
A second source with knowledge of the trysts between Trump and McDougal, and who testified in the trial, confirmed the relationship began ""soon after the birth.""
Steinglass dropped the apparent bombshell on the very first day journalists flooded the chilly Manhattan courtroom for the trial, before a single juror had been selected.
He asked the judge, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, to allow McDougal to testify about it.
""Karen McDougal is a former Playboy model who claimed to have had a romantic and sexual relationship with Mr. Trump that lasted nearly a year, including while Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, was pregnant with their child,"" Assistant District Attorney Steinglass told the judge.
But something didn't add up.
In previous media interviews, McDougal said the affair spanned 10 months, beginning around Trump's birthday in June 2006 and lasting until April 2007.
Barron Trump, the sole child of Donald and Melania Trump, was born in March 2006 — before McDougal says the affair took place.

According to Heller, Merchan relied on Steinglass's error when he ruled prosecutors should not question McDougal about the subject on the witness stand.
Steinglass had told the judge he would not elicit ""the salacious details of the affair, to describe the sexual acts or locales of their liaisons"" from McDougal — unless Trump's lawyers would ""open the door"" to it. But the judge, in his ruling, said it would be ""prejudicial"" to bring up ""the defendant's wife was pregnant with a child at the time, and that this went on while she was pregnant and even after she gave birth.""
""Steinglass misspoke about Melania being pregnant during the affair, and Merchan relied on the incorrect impression he gave when he talked about Melania being pregnant,"" Heller told BI.
""As everyone has previously reported, including Karen herself: Karen met Mr. Trump at the Playboy Mansion when they were filming an episode of The Apprentice,"" Heller said. ""This was June of 2006. Barron was already three months old.""
Prosecutors ultimately never called McDougal to testify, so the timeline discrepancy wasn't raised again and didn't become the subject of further scrutiny in the trial. Jurors never heard any evidence about it either way.
The detail ultimately proved inconsequential to winning the case.
The Manhattan District Attorney's Office charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels — a different woman who says she had an affair with him — to unlawfully keep the information secret ahead of the 2016 presidential election.
Steinglass marshaled an almost-dizzying matrix of dates and other details in a marathon five-hour closing argument.
The jury convicted Trump of all 34 counts.
McDougal's story helped explain 'catch and kill'
In the past, Trump has boasted about his infidelity in general terms, but has seldom publicly talked about McDougal in particular.
In the April court hearing, Trump's lead defense attorney, Todd Blanche, called McDougal's story ""unproven"" but did not discuss the details of her claims.
Neither Blanche nor representatives for Melania Trump responded to requests for comment for this story.
""Until Mr. Trump himself confirms their affair, or until any witness in whom he has previously confided comes forward to verify his admission, I suppose Mr. Blanche can legally describe their affair as 'unproven,'"" Heller told BI. ""Karen will always hold it as the truth, because it is.""
Daniels received $130,000 in hush money in October 2016. The alleged affair with McDougal was the subject of an earlier hush-money arrangement, in June of that year.
McDougal's $150,000 in hush money wasn't the subject of any criminal charges, but it helped prosecutors explain the ""catch and kill"" arrangements between Trump, the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid, and people who claimed to have unsavory information about him.

In media interviews, McDougal has said she met Trump when NBC filmed an episode of ""The Apprentice"" at the Playboy Mansion in June 2006. (They also both participated in a softcore Playboy movie released in 2000.) The two had dinner a week later in Los Angeles, around Trump's 60th birthday, McDougal has said.
Before the two had sex after the dinner, McDougal asked Trump about naming his then-3-month-old son Barron, according to ""The Fixers,"" a book by journalists Joe Palazzolo and Michael Rothfeld, who broke the stories about the ""catch and kill"" arrangements involving Trump, McDougal, and Daniels.
The idea that Trump had an affair while Melania Trump was pregnant may have originated from a text message from Gina Rodriquez, a talent agent who previously represented Daniels.
In an October 2016 text message to Dylan Howard, who then served as the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, Rodriguez said Daniels would ""take a lie detector and go on the record"" about the affair taking place while Melania was pregnant.
""Donald Trump had sex with Stormy Daniels while his current wife was pregnant,"" Rodriguez wrote in the text message. ""He flew Stormy to his Pageant and told her he would get her on Celebrity Apprentice which he never did.""
But that doesn't appear to be true, either.
According to trial testimony from Stormy Daniels, she met Trump at a Lake Tahoe celebrity golf tournament in July of 2006 — months after Barron Trump was born.
Rodriguez didn't respond to a request for comment.

Trump also met and slept with McDougal again during the event, according to ""The Fixers."" And the timeline for both affairs overlapped. According to Daniels' testimony, McDougal even also showed up at subsequent events Trump invited her to.
McDougal's claims first came to the attention of Michael Cohen — who then served as Trump's personal lawyer and fixer — in 2015. When Cohen raised her story of an affair with Trump, he didn't deny it, Cohen testified in the trial.
""She's really beautiful,"" Trump remarked, according to Cohen's testimony.
In a May 17 statement, McDougal said details of her experience remained ""to be disclosed on my own terms, at a time of my own choosing."" She was responding to CNN re-running a 2018 interview she gave to Anderson Cooper, where she first publicly laid out the timeline of the affair.
""What has not changed is the truth that I have always told,"" McDougal said.
In the interview with Cooper, McDougal expressed guilt about her relationship with Trump, since he was married.
""Back in that day, I was a different girl, I had fun,"" she said. ""I was in the Playboy scene. I was just enjoying life as much as I could.""
But there was a spark, she said.
""There was a real relationship there. There was real — there were feelings between the two of us,"" she said. ""Not just myself, not just him. There was a real relationship there.""

Trump tells sweltering rally in Nevada he won't tax tips,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-hold-rally-swing-state-100224615.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",4:14 AM GMT+5:30,4 min read,"By Nathan Layne and David Lawder
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) -Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday that he would seek to end taxation of income from tips, a direct appeal to service workers in the swing state of Nevada, which polls suggest is leaning his way ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
Trump also once again valorized his supporters convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, calling them ""warriors"" and suggesting a possible counter-investigation into the event if he were re-elected.
The pledge on tips, revealed at a sweltering outdoor rally in Las Vegas where temperatures reached 100 degrees, adds one more detail to a Trump tax plan that has included vague pledges of tax relief to middle-income workers and small businesses.
""So this is the first time I've said this, and for those hotel workers and people that get tips you're going to be very happy because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips people (are) making,"" Trump told a crowd of several thousand people.
Trump said he would ""do that right away, first thing in office,"" and noted in prepared remarks that he would seek legislation in Congress to make the change. ""You do a great job of service, you take care of people and I think it's going to be something that really is deserved.""
Trump has previously pledged to make permanent the Republican-passed individual tax cuts that he signed into law in 2017 but which expire at the end of 2025. Tax experts estimate that doing so would raise U.S. deficits by some $4 trillion over a decade compared to current forecasts.
As current law requires, tipped employees must report their tips as income. Eliminating this would add further to deficits without new revenues elsewhere.
Trump's Democratic opponent, President Joe Biden

, has pledged to maintain Trump's tax cuts for households earning under $400,000 a year, but wants to substantially raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and on large corporations.
The Las Vegas speech was Trump's first large-scale rally since a New York jury found him guilty on May 30 of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to a porn star on the eve of the 2016 election, making him the first former U.S. president convicted of a crime.
Trump also continued to hammer Biden on illegal immigration, predicting that Biden's move last week enacting a broad asylum ban on migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border would not make a difference, even though the ban is similar to restrictions Trump tried to implement when he was president.
""It's bullshit what he signed,"" Trump said of Biden's executive order, prompting a wave of chants by the crowd repeating the profanity.
For days, Las Vegas residents have been coping with unusually high temperatures, part of a heatwave scorching the U.S. Southwest. The Trump campaign set up misting stations while partially overcast skies and a breeze helped mitigate the heat, though a handful of people had to be taken away for treatment.
SWING STATES
Trump, who has repeatedly called people imprisoned for their roles in the Capitol attack ""hostages"" and said he may pardon them, on Sunday described them as ""warriors"" without blame.
""Those ‘J-six’ warriors - they were warriors - but they were really more than anything else, they’re victims of what happened. All they were doing is protesting a rigged election.""
Nevada is one of six or seven swing states likely to determine the election. A Fox News survey conducted after the guilty verdict showed Trump ahead of Biden in Nevada by five percentage points, an advantage roughly in line with an average of polls compiled by poll tracking website FiveThirtyEight.
Rebecca Gill, a political science professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said she was skeptical that polls were fully capturing where voters will be in a few months, given that many are not yet paying attention to the race.
Gill said she did not think Trump's criminal conviction has fully sunk in with voters and could deter some moderate Republicans from backing him. In addition, a proposed amendment to enshrine access to abortion in the state constitution would, if it makes it onto the ballot, likely boost Democratic turnout.
""I think that (Nevada) is 100% still in play,"" Gill said.
Sunday's rally comes on the heels of a three-day fundraising push by Trump that included stops in San Francisco, Beverly Hills and Las Vegas, during which he raised $33.5 million from donors, according to senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita.

Shirley Weber: 'Godmother of reparations',https://www.yahoo.com/news/shirley-weber-godmother-reparations-100056241.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",3:30 PM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"In the triple-digit heat of summer, Thursdays in downtown Sacramento are usually quiet. But not on June 29 last year.
The March Fong Eu Secretary of State Building was jumpin' like a Black church on Sunday, the joyous shouts from teary-eyed Black people impossible to ignore. But Shirley Weber, California's secretary of state, tried to anyway during the final meeting of the state's reparations task force.
""Your work will forever live,"" the Rev. Amos Brown, a task force member, told her. ""God bless you.""
Weber, 75, has long been a force in Democratic politics, from the San Diego Board of Education to the state Assembly to her current role — a first for a Black woman. But lately, she has achieved near-rock-star status as something less official: The “godmother of reparations.”
It was her Assembly Bill 3121 that led California to do what Congress has refused to do — appoint a task force to study the lasting harms of slavery and recommend what compensation is owed for decades of systemically racist laws and policies. State lawmakers are now grappling with many pieces of proposed legislation stemming from the task force's recommendations. It has been a hard, slow slog.
It's work that has breathed new life into the national reparations movement, turning what many Americans had long seen as a joke into a serious, often inescapable policy discussion.
'Your work will forever live.'
The Rev. Amos Brown, a member of California's reparations task force on Shirley Weber's contributions
Inspired by California, New York and Illinois have created their own task forces. Cities across the country have done or are considering doing the same. Meanwhile, long buried stories of injustice, such as Bruce's Beach, have been unearthed and addressed.
The timing of AB 3121 helped. Weber introduced it in February 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police — the combination sparking a national racial reckoning.
But what Weber did wasn't just about timing; it also was about vision.
The same Thursday the reparations task force met for the final time, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down affirmative action policies at colleges and universities. Since then, corporate and nonprofit programs that benefit people of color have been targeted too.
So it's notable that Weber has focused on harm, not race. Using her influence with the task force, she ensured that reparations would go not to ""Black people,"" but to people whose ancestors were enslaved. Legally, it’s the only way it can work. And in Sacramento, lawmakers have introduced a flurry of bills this year to ensure that it does.
""When you have done harm,"" Weber said, ""you have a responsibility to correct it. And to make sure it never happens again.""

"This California congressman is all over TV and TikTok, touting Biden ... and himself",https://www.yahoo.com/news/california-congressman-over-tv-tiktok-100010010.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",3:30 PM GMT+5:30,12 min read,"Rep. Ro Khanna, one of President Biden's most visible supporters, came to Michigan recently to accept a “courage in public service” award from an Arab American group that opposes American support for Israel in Gaza — and detests Biden.
The tension of the California congressman's dual roles — as a presidential surrogate and one of many Democrats building his own base for a post-Biden era — was evident before dinner was served. James P. Allen, chairman of the Arab American Civil Rights League, was blunt as he introduced Khanna to local Democratic power brokers over cocktails.
“We are going to work night and day to defeat Biden,” Allen said.
Democrats need a dose of ""Trump chemotherapy,” Allen added, likening Trump to a toxin that would purge Biden, the cancer, from the Democratic Party.
Khanna pushed back awkwardly but not convincingly. ""I disagree because we've got a journalist [here],"" he said, pointing to the reporter he allowed to shadow him for the night.
Undeterred, Allen repeated the metaphor before Khanna shifted the conversation to himself: “You think people like me can pick up the pieces in the future?”
“I do,” Allen told him. “The future of the Democratic Party is with people of color.”
“And on the right side of this issue,” Khanna said, highlighting his difference with Biden over Israel.
Through four terms representing the Bay Area's 17th District in Congress, Khanna has sought to build a reputation as a unique crossover artist.
A Silicon Valley progressive who can build his sizable political war chest with fundraising help from the likes of David Sacks — a venture capitalist who hosted a Trump fundraiser Thursday — but who endorsed Bernie Sanders’ democratic socialist bid for president.
An ally to angry Palestinian-rights activists who can still attend bill-signing ceremonies with the president.
A politician who decried the “anachronism of two 80-year-olds running for president” to a group of college Democrats while insisting he was there to help one of those old men get reelected.
Does he plan a White House run? He gets asked often, and seems to relish it.
Read more: What’s behind the anti-Biden ‘wildfire’ among TikTok influencers
“Who knows?” Khanna replied as he waited to board the flight from Washington to Detroit. “What is the zeitgeist of 2028 or 2032 going to be?”
It’s a tough decision, he said. He and his wife, Ritu, whose immigrant parents became wealthy selling auto transmissions, have two children, aged 5 and 6. They live in Washington but he travels extensively, both to his district and to political events, while trying to spend the mornings and alternating weekends with them.
He hit the ""lottery"" with Ritu, he said, but worries about the impact of social media on his family. Still, he's keeping his options open, giving speeches in Michigan and New Hampshire to get his message out. “I certainly want to be part of the national conversation.”
It’s not unusual for members of the House to imagine themselves as president, but only two have made the leap directly, and one was Abraham Lincoln.
Khanna would have to leapfrog better-known home-state rivals like Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Still, there's plenty of precedent in using a presidential campaign to build a profile as the party's unofficial progressive leader. Sanders, who achieved that role through two insurgent runs for president in 2016 and 2020, is 82, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who fought for the 2020 nomination, is 74.
“He pays attention to his politics,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat who leads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said of Khanna. “He's very close to our revolution.”
Khanna doesn’t yell or crack many jokes, but admirers and opponents note how the congressman, who is always in a suit, sees value in engaging his critics and anyone else who wants to hear from him. It’s hard to find a reporter in Washington who doesn’t have his cellphone number.

His office estimated that he appeared on television 142 times in 2023, nearly three times a week, including local, cable and Sunday network news hits. He laughed as he recounted how former Vice President Al Gore recently ribbed him for going on air so often.
His campaign pays a social media consultant who cultivates relationships with influencers and helps generate videos that draw 100,000 and sometimes a million views on TikTok and other platforms.
Last year, Khanna was a loud and lonely Democratic voice calling for the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein to resign amid an extended absence from work.
“I think he’s accurately assessing the careerism and corresponding mediocrity of the political class,” said former Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who worked closely with Khanna on China and other issues.
Khanna won legitimacy on the left by backing Sanders in 2020 and has addressed his own potential vulnerabilities, including a personal fortune worth tens of millions of dollars through his wife’s family, by backing the Green New Deal and other anti-corporate positions, Jayapal said. He has made contacts with activist organizations and used his $10-million campaign account to boost up-and-coming candidates and state parties.
“So obviously, he's got a path lined up for himself,” she said with a chuckle.
But even allies question that goal.
“We make a mistake by saying, ‘Who's going to be the leader of the progressives?’ because we have many, many leaders,” said Rep. Barbara Lee, the Oakland Democrat whom Khanna endorsed for the Senate this year and counts as a mentor. “In a democracy, we work collectively.""
Khanna seems undaunted. His brand of “progressive capitalism” differs from the focus placed on social issues by culturally progressive lawmakers, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
Khanna also differs from Sanders’ democratic socialist philosophy, in part because his agenda includes a dollop of “wealth generation” — often in the form of subsidies that help the corporate giants Sanders rails against — to bring jobs to working-class Americans. At the same time, he supports high taxes on the wealthy and free universal healthcare.
The same tech boom that has made his district wealthy, he’s reasoned, could bring jobs to areas of the country that suffered as manufacturing shifted overseas.
The zeal for spreading tech wealth to West Virginia, Michigan and other neglected regions has not hurt his ability to win over voters and financial backers in Silicon Valley's tech sector, his primary backers since he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2014 against Mike Honda, a fellow progressive Democrat who served eight terms. Khanna won in 2016.
In 2022, when Intel Corp. broke ground on a semiconductor factory in Ohio, Khanna was there, as were Biden and other lawmakers. Bruce Andrews, the company's chief government affairs officer, told The Times that he’d never seen an elected official so excited about investment outside their district.
The facility is funded in part through the CHIPS and Science Act, and Khanna had been a bridge in the negotiations over the legislation with Democrats who were more skeptical of corporations, which won billions of dollars in subsidies in the law.
“He spent a lot of time explaining to them how the economics worked and how Taiwan and Korea and China have spent 30 years incentivizing this industry,” Andrews said. “If we want to get those jobs back and build, rebuild and rebuild manufacturing in the United States, we have to close the cost gap between the U.S. and Asia.”

China has been a particular target of Khanna's, reflecting the national mood that helped Trump get elected and pushed many Democrats, including Biden, toward a more confrontational industrial policy with Beijing.
“He comes at it more from an economic warfare perspective, and I come at it more from an actual warfare perspective,” said Gallagher, the former Wisconsin congressman.
The two also collaborated on congressional term limits legislation, traveling to Trump’s White House to seek an audience with the president. They got a tweet from Trump, but the bill died.
“He has a very legit resume and background and has interacted with every major leader in the tech world and probably sees the energy, the natural churn of talent, and the ability of people at a relatively young age to have a massive impact,” Gallagher said.
During their time working together on China issues, Gallagher was impressed with Khanna’s ability to get tech barons and venture capitalists on the phone.
But the coziness with tech has drawn skepticism from fellow progressives and industry critics, who see Silicon Valley as the prime example of concentrated wealth and power and the aversion to regulation that comes with it.
Some critics point to extensive trading of stocks — some of it tech companies — in his wife's portfolio. He insisted that his wife’s extensive roster of quarterly stock trades does not violate his belief that members of Congress should not buy and sell stocks because, in her case, the stocks are traded by a third party as part of a diversified trust.
“It’s very hard to see how you can express affection for Silicon Valley giants and be a full-throated advocate for social democracy,” said Jeff Hauser, who heads the Revolving Door Project, a corporate influence watchdog.
Khanna disputes that view, pointing to his vocal support for a sweeping bipartisan Senate bill (which ultimately failed) to regulate tech. But he did not support a similar effort in the House when he had the chance in 2021, drawing more skepticism from critics who see a gap between his rhetoric and actions.
Garrett Ventry, a former Republican congressional aide who worked on antitrust issues, said Khanna dodged many of the bipartisan efforts to curb the power of Apple, Google and Amazon, despite his “Elizabeth Warren rhetoric.”
“That really speaks more volumes than just saying tough things on Twitter,” Ventry said.
In advance of his Dearborn visit, Khanna and his staff billed it “a major speech” to lay out his vision for the Middle East, a bit lofty for a rank-and-file member of the House minority. But he was nervous on the way there. His campaign’s videographer was stuck in a long security line in New York, jeopardizing his plan to clip the speech for social media.
Khanna was not sure how a call for civility and a two-state solution would go over. He said he would deliver the same speech he'd give if he were speaking to a pro-Israel group.
But the speech in Michigan omitted a line from an op-ed he published that morning, adapted from the speech, which condemned the phrase “from the river to the sea,” which many Israelis and American Jews see as a call to eliminate Jews from Israel. Khanna said the Washington Post added that line and he never intended it as part of the speech.
His op-ed and speech never mentioned Biden or noted how Trump banned visitors from primarily Muslim countries and took a more hawkishly anti-Palestinian position than Biden. It would be inappropriate, Khanna said to a reporter, to upstage the award with this talk, and he wasn't there in his role as a Biden surrogate.
After about an hour of selfies and political networking, Khanna sat down for a dinner of lamb, chicken and rice. Other speakers described the community’s profound pain and anger, none more so than Allen.
“Our own president, who many of us voted for” is “a willing accomplice to murder,” Allen told the audience.
“This betrayal is compounded by the pernicious influence of dual loyalties, where our elected officials nakedly serve, not the American people, but foreign interests,” Allen continued, echoing the language of antisemetic tropes.
Khanna smiled awkwardly but congratulated Allen and the other speakers as they left the dais.
“I hope my speech goes over well,” Khanna said to a reporter during another set of fiery remarks. “That’s a pretty radical speech.”
As his turn arrived, Khanna appeared composed.
“I'm not going to tell you maybe all that you want to hear,” Khanna told the crowd, offering “a new approach to political dialogue in America.”
Over 15 minutes, he tried to find common ground, a two-state solution, a mutual recognition, coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis. Iranians too. He invoked the inspiration of his grandfather Amarnath Vidyalankar, a member of Gandhi's independence movement in India who spent four years in jail and eventually served in the country's first parliament.
Khanna didn't use the words genocide or ethnic cleansing as the other speakers did. He called for a permanent cease-fire and a release of hostages.
There were maybe two boos when Khanna reaffirmed Israel’s right to exist, and the concluding applause was polite.
Khanna thought it went well, and the group’s founder muttered later that the speech sounded presidential.
Mingling afterward, attendees offered similar praise, and if they said nothing, Khanna asked what they thought. His political director, Elizabeth Cavalieri, then recorded testimonials from a few of them to post on TikTok.
It had been a long night, and almost everyone was cleared out. But Allen, the one who had sworn to defeat Biden, was filming a TikTok video with Cavalieri praising Khanna’s speech, repeatedly mispronouncing his name as “Ka-hanna.”
When Allen finished, he told Cavalieri they needed to stay in touch. He’s raised a lot of money over the years and wants to help Khanna with what’s next.

Biden honors US war dead with a cemetery visit ending a French trip that served as a rebuke to Trump,https://www.yahoo.com/news/cemetery-visit-close-biden-trip-040131017.html,"Updated Mon, June 10, 2024",1:47 AM GMT+5:30,7 min read,"BELLEAU, France (AP) — President Joe Biden closed out his trip to France by paying his respects at an American military cemetery that Donald Trump notably skipped when he was president, hoping his final stop Sunday helped draw the stakes of the November election in stark relief.
Before returning to the United States, Biden honored America’s war dead at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery about an hour outside Paris. He placed a wreath at the cemetery chapel before an expanse of white headstones marking the final resting place of more than 2,200 U.S. soldiers who fought in World War I.
It was a solemn end to five days in which Trump was an unspoken yet unavoidable presence. On the surface, the trip marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day and celebrated the alliance between the United States and France. But during an election year when Trump has called into question fundamental understandings about America's global role, Biden has embraced his Republican predecessor — and would-be successor — as a latent foil.
Every ode to the transatlantic partnership was a reminder that Trump could upend those relationships. Each reference to democracy stood a counterpoint to his rival's efforts to overturn a presidential election. The myriad exhortations to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia created a contrast with Trump's skepticism about providing U.S. assistance.
Biden's paeans to the struggle between democracy and autocracy drew plaudits in Europe, where the prospect of a return to Trump's turbulent reign has sparked no shortage of anxiety. But it remains to be seen how the message will resonate with American voters, as Biden's campaign struggles to connect the dire warnings the Democratic president so often delivers about his rival with people's daily concerns.
The visit to the cemetery served as a moment to underscore the contrast once more.
“It’s the same story,"" Biden said. ""America showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans. America showed up to make sure that they did not prevail. And America shows up when we’re needed just like our allies show for us.”
During a 2018 trip to France, Trump skipped plans to go to the cemetery, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time. However, subsequent reports said that Trump told aides he didn’t want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as “suckers” and “losers.” Trump has denied the comments, although they were later corroborated by his chief of staff at the time, John Kelly.
Trump’s purported insults have become a regular feature of Biden’s campaign speeches, including during an April rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
“These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation,” Biden said. “Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office.""
Biden ignored a direct question about Trump at the cemetery but said it was important to visit the hallowed ground. “The idea that I would come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute,"" he added, his voice trailing off as if to express disbelief.
Trump, at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, said Sunday after Biden had left France that the president's performance overseas was “terrible"" and embarrassing, though Trump did not cite anything in particular. “This is not a representative for what used to be the greatest country,” he told his supporters, adding that under Biden ""we are a nation in major decline and we’re going to stop it immediately.”
Maura Sullivan, a former Marine officer who served on the American Battle Monuments Commission under President Barack Obama, said Biden's visit would “set the example, and do what a president should do.” Now an official with the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Sullivan said that “voters can draw their own conclusions” from that.
Biden’s trip was full of emotional moments, and the president grew heavy-eyed after meeting with World War II veterans. A 21-gun salute cast eerie smoke over 9,388 white marble headstones at the Normandy American Cemetery.
“This has been the most remarkable trip that I’ve ever made,” Biden said on Saturday night, his last in Paris before returning to the U.S.
At Aisne-Marne, Biden said the trip “surprised me how much it awakened my sense of why it’s so valuable to have these alliances. Why it’s so critical. That’s the way you stop wars, not start wars.”
His remarks over the last few days were also freighted with political overtones.
On Thursday at Normandy anniversary ceremonies, Biden said D-Day served a reminder that alliances make the United States stronger, calling it “a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.” He also highlighted how the war effort drew on immigrants, women and people of color who were too often overlooked by history.
Then on Friday, he went to Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the coast where Army Rangers scaled cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses on D-Day that was also the site in 1984 of one of President Ronald Reagan's most memorable speeches about the struggles between the West and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
By following in an iconic Republican’s footsteps, Biden honed his appeal to traditional conservatives who are often frustrated by Trump's isolationist vision. Biden issued a call for Americans to protect democracy like the Rangers who scaled the cliffs, a message that synced with campaign rhetoric that paints his election opponent as an existential threat to U.S. values.
While Biden was in France, his campaign announced that it had hired the onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to lead outreach to GOP voters. Kinzinger clashed with Trump’s foreign policy and efforts to overturn the last presidential election.
At Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the Army Rangers “fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the ’30s and ’40s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?”
Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to devote more attention to its own problems and less to foreign alliances and entanglements. He has also routinely played down the importance of American partnerships, suggesting the U.S. could abandon its treaty commitments to defend European allies if they don’t pay enough for their own defenses.
Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who wrote a book about Pointe du Hoc and Reagan’s speech, said Biden “had big shoes to step into” by choosing the same location.
Biden's speech “didn’t equal Reagan’s in grandeur, nor could it,” Brinkley said. Still, he said Biden “said the right words about why democracy matters.”
Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist, said it could help Biden politically “to stand where Reagan stood.""
He noted that Biden is struggling with younger voters but appears to be gaining strength among older ones who may be more receptive to reminders of Reagan’s speech four decades ago.
“He needs a lot of Reagan Republicans to offset his challenges with younger voters,” he said.
Biden's trip was also punctuated by the pomp of a state visit in Paris.
French President Emmanuel Macron arranged a ceremony at the Arc du Triomphe, where four fighter jets flew overhead, and hosted a banquet at the Elysee presidential palace.
“United we stand, divided we fall,” Macron said in toasting Biden. “Allied we are, and allied we will stay.”
Overall, Biden’s visit had a slower pace than other foreign trips. The 81-year-old president had no public events on his first day in Paris after arriving on an overnight flight, and didn't hold a press conference with reporters, as is customary. John Kirby, a national security spokesman, said that was necessary to prepare “in advance of the weighty engagements” during subsequent days.
“There's a lot on the calendar,” he said.
Still, it was a contrast to Macron’s tendency to offer prestigious guests an intense schedule with a mix of official meetings, business talks, cultural events and private dinners at fancy restaurants.
When the 46-year-old French leader hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, the two-day agenda was crammed with activities including a trip to the Pyrenees Mountains near the border with Spain where Macron spent time as a child.

Thousands gather outside White House to protest war in Gaza,https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-gather-outside-white-house-013240043.html,"Updated Sun, June 9, 2024",10:36 PM GMT+5:30,6 min read,"WASHINGTON — Thousands of people from cities across the country gathered outside the White House on Saturday to protest the Biden administration’s policies toward the Israel-Hamas war, many dressed in keffiyehs and red clothes to symbolize what they say is a red line that Israel crossed.
Hundreds of protesters held a red banner that stretched around the White House, urging President Joe Biden to change his approach to the war in Gaza.
“Biden, Biden you can’t hide, we are your red line,” protesters chanted.
“The intention is to draw a red line where Biden won’t draw one when it comes to Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and say we as the people are drawing the red line today to say enough is enough,” said Nas Issa, a protester from the Palestinian Youth Movement. “It’s time for an arms embargo, and it’s time to end this.”

Later, protesters bearing tents set up an encampment in the Ellipse, the 52-acre park directly south of the White House. Some protesters told NBC News that student community organizers led the move to start an encampment.
Some of the protesters boarded buses to the protest from cities including New York City, Philadelphia and Boston, according to one of the organizing groups’ posts on the social media site X.
“Sometimes it feels a little helpless because everyone talks about the fact that it started Oct. 7. Meanwhile, there’s been decades of oppression, illegal detentions, illegal occupations, illegal settlements,” said Ibrahim Dabdoub, who drove to D.C. from Nashville, Tennessee.

Dabdoub attended the protest with his two sisters. The three siblings of Palestinian descent traveled from Canada, Tennessee and North Carolina for the protest.
Dabdoub and his sister Dania voted for Biden in 2020 — their third sister attending the protest is not an American citizen — but neither plans to support him this November.
“I regret everything,” Dania Dabdoub said of her 2020 vote, adding that she “will never vote for him again.”
Similarly, Qais Musmar, who traveled from Springfield, Virginia, for the protest, said he voted for Biden in 2020, adding, “I kind of regret it right now.” He said he would probably vote for an independent candidate in November, though “there’s a lot that [Biden] could do” to change his mind.
Ehab Abutavikh traveled from near Paterson, New Jersey, to participate in this protest, his first, with his cousin and aunt. Abutavikh’s family is from Gaza and about a dozen family members have died in the war, he said.
He said his message to those in the White House was that they needed to “open their eyes” and “end what’s happening.” Abutavikh was not old enough to vote in 2020 and said he does not know yet how he plans to vote in November.
Organizers and politicians, including Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and Socialism Party candidate Claudia De la Cruz, railed against the Biden administration during speeches in the park directly across from the White House.
“Biden can stop the genocide that is currently happening in Gaza,” De la Cruz said. “He could stop it, but it goes against all his interests. And so we are here to say that we are the red line.”
The messages from protesters ranged from pushing for an end to the war and a change in U.S. policy to calls against a two-state solution.
“We don’t want no two state, we’re taking back ’48,” some protesters chanted, referring to the 1948 war that led to the establishment of the state of Israel.
A group of protesters also yelled, “Say it loud, say it clear, we don’t want no Zionists here.”

Hundreds of signs dotted the crowds, many with messages like “lift the siege on Gaza now” and “genocide is our red line,” but a few had controversial messages including a sign that said “f--- Israel, stand with Hamas.” Another sign displayed a Star of David with red handprints around it.
A handful of protesters wore green headbands that appeared to be similar to those worn by members of Hamas.
One protester wearing the headband said that it was “Hamas’ one,” though the protester said he does not speak Arabic and was not sure what it said. When asked if he supported Hamas, the protester, who would not give his name, said that he “wouldn’t say supporter, I would say maybe sympathizer.”
Hamas is designated by the U.S. to be a terrorist organization and spearheaded the Oct. 7 attack on Israel where about 1,200 people were killed and around 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. More than 36,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and it is unclear how many are civilians versus militants.
""President Biden has always been clear that every American has the right to peacefully express their views,"" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement. ""But he has also always been clear that Antisemitism, violent rhetoric, and endorsing murderous terrorist organizations like Hamas is repugnant, dangerous, and against everything we stand for as a country.""
Bates also pointed to the administration urging Hamas to accept the ceasefire deal laid out by Biden at the end of May.
The vast majority of protesters did not espouse pro-Hamas views.
Rob Stephens, who lives in D.C., said he wanted to join the protest because his mother was a Holocaust survivor.
“I think she would be here too,” he said, adding that she would be “appalled.”
Stephens voted for Biden in 2020 and plans to vote for the president again this November because he does not “want a fascist, wannabe Hitler,” appearing to refer to former President Donald Trump.
Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said that the president “believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans.”
“He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East,” the statement continued. “He’s working tirelessly to that end.”
Multiple statues in Lafayette Square across from the White House were vandalized during the protest with spray paint, graffiti and painted red handprints. Protesters attached signs reading slogans such as “Hands off Rafah! Stop the genocide!” to statues. Some graffitied slogans such as “free Gaza,” “kill pigs” and “f--- pigs” on the statues.
Police said they attempted to arrest one person who climbed a statue, but members of the crowd intervened. The police deployed pepper spray and the person got away.
Biden is currently in France, not at the White House.
The president’s rhetoric toward Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become increasingly critical in recent months.
Just days ago, Biden said in an interview with Time magazine that there was “every reason” to believe that Netanyahu was prolonging the war for political gain. Biden has previously said that Netanyahu was making a “mistake” with his handling of the war.

Migrant arrests drop at US-Mexico border as Biden asylum ban rolls out,https://www.yahoo.com/news/migrant-arrests-drop-us-mexico-232215249.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",4:52 AM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border dropped on Friday, a senior U.S. border official told Reuters, saying it signaled a restrictive new Biden

administration policy was deterring some illegal immigration.
U.S. Border Patrol arrested around 3,100 people crossing illegally, down roughly 20% from the days before, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss preliminary figures.
""It's still too early to say this is a definitive trend,"" the official said. ""But I think it is indicative of some possible early success.""
Immigration has emerged as a top issue for Americans in the months before Nov. 5 elections that will decide control of the White House and Congress. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term, faces Republican Donald Trump - an immigration hardliner - in a rematch of the 2020 contest.
Biden took office in 2021 pledging to reverse many of Trump's restrictive immigration policies but has toughened his stance in the face of record migrant arrests at the border.
Biden implemented a sweeping policy on Wednesday that generally bars migrants who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border from claiming asylum. The asylum ban has exceptions for unaccompanied minors, people who face serious medical or safety threats, and victims of trafficking.
The new policy aims to maximize the number of migrants placed in ""expedited removal,"" a fast-track deportation process. Since Wednesday, more than 2,000 people per day were put in expedited removal, more than double the previous rate, the U.S. official said.
Questions still remain about whether border crossings will stay low enough to process people quickly and whether U.S. authorities have the capacity to meet their goals.
The American Civil Liberties Union has vowed to sue to halt the measure, which resembles Trump-era curbs on asylum.

7 Democrats who could replace Biden if he drops his 2024 reelection bid,https://www.yahoo.com/news/7-democrats-could-replace-biden-202416711.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",1:54 AM GMT+5:30,8 min read,"President Joe Biden's reelection bid has the strong backing of most elected Democrats.
Biden is committed to the race, but there's public speculation on whether he'll stay in the contest.
In the unlikely event that Biden left the race, an array of Democrats would be in the mix to lead the party.
After President Joe Biden announced his reelection bid last April, the vast majority of Democratic leaders coalesced around his candidacy, which wasn't surprising for an incumbent.
But Biden has one of the most unusual backgrounds of any president in US history: He's been a fixture in Washington for more than 50 years as a Delaware senator, vice president, and now president. And if he's reelected to a second term this fall, he'd be 82 years old at the time of his inauguration in January 2025 and 86 at the end of a second term.
Biden's age has become a cause of concern among many voters, including some who are inclined to back him over former President Donald Trump. The worries were amplified after the special counsel Robert Hur released his report on the probe into Biden's handling of classified documents, in which no charges were recommended, but the president's acuity and memory were questioned.
Through it all, Biden has defended his reelection bid, argued that his age is an asset, pushed back against the special-counsel report, and articulated why he should be reelected — pointing to accomplishments such as the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Inflation Reduction Act and touting the low national unemployment numbers.
What does this all mean? Biden is unlikely to leave the race, especially as he dominated the Democratic presidential primaries and is committed to a rematch with Trump. But speculation about whether he'll bow out of the contest continues to swirl.
In the event that Biden does somehow bow out after winning the overwhelming majority of the 3,936 delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination, a new nominee would have to be selected at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this August. But it'd be a messy process given that the primaries are now completed.
Virtually every major Democratic governor or senator is behind the president's reelection bid and long ago dismissed the thought of replacing him on the ballot this year.
But who could be a Biden successor if such a scenario were to occur?
Vice President Kamala Harris

Harris, by many measures, would be a natural successor to Biden.
As vice president, she's worked closely with Biden on things as varied as voting rights and foreign policy. She was previously a San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, and California senator and is a historic figure in her own right as the first Black, Indian American, and female vice president.
And she has become the face of the administration's challenge to the raft of GOP-crafted abortion restrictions following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.
But Harris previously launched a 2020 presidential bid that seemed promising but fell flat with voters over time. (She eventually ended her campaign before the start of the primaries and caucuses.)
As vice president, Harris has been heavily praised by Biden. But her office struggled with turnover and reports of dysfunction earlier in her term. She has also had to contend with less-than-ideal approval ratings, which have raised concerns among some Democrats about her electability as the party also looks to 2028 — when she'd be a potential frontrunner, given her positive marks with Black voters and young voters.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former San Francisco mayor who was also California's lieutenant governor, leads the most populated state in the country and, in recent years, has become one of Biden's most prominent Democratic surrogates.
California is often used as a foil by national Republicans to contrast with the conservative policies of states such as Florida and Texas. But Newsom has been outspoken in not only promoting the Golden State but touting Democratic policy stances and legislative wins — and he's not afraid to take his arguments straight to the GOP.
As governor, Newsom has taken on more moderate stances in recent years on issues involving labor and tackling homelessness in his state.
Newsom's political trajectory could collide with that of Harris, his fellow Bay Area native, but they've long maintained a strong working relationship, and the governor has been highly complimentary of her work with Biden.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer

of Michigan

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the two-term governor of battleground Michigan, is accustomed to tough political fights. And over the course of her governorship, she has won a lot of those battles: Democrats in recent years have performed strongly in the Wolverine State, holding every top statewide office and flipping control of the state legislature in the 2022 midterm elections.
When Whitmer ran for reelection in 2022 against the Republican Tudor Dixon, she won by nearly 11 points, reflective of her broad appeal with the electorate in a state where the margins are often tight.
This fall, Michigan is expected to be one of the closest states in the country in the presidential race. And Whitmer, a former state lawmaker and ex-prosecutor, is set to be a critical voice for the Biden campaign across Michigan.
The governor has encouraged Biden to speak more forcefully about abortion rights, an issue that has galvanized many voters — but especially women — across the country after Roe was overturned.
In a potential field without Biden, Whitmer's Midwestern background, strong alliance with organized labor, and moderate appeal could make her a strong contender. But she would also be a new face in a contest that will probably feature Trump on the GOP side.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's served in the Senate since 2007, ran for president in 2020 and made a surprisingly strong finish in the New Hampshire primary — even outperforming Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the time.
But her campaign wasn't able to get the sort of momentum it needed in the South Carolina primary for her to continue her bid, and she exited the race.
Still, Klobuchar would be a candidate to watch in an open field, as she boosted her national presence in the primary and could point to a long-standing record of bipartisan accomplishments representing Minnesota in the Senate.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey

Sen. Cory Booker also ran for president in 2020, ending his campaign in January that year.
But the former Newark mayor has been a national figure for years and is seen as a likely 2028 contender.
He could easily jump-start a potential 2028 campaign in South Carolina, as he campaigned throughout the state in 2019 and 2020.
In the scenario that Democrats would have to choose a candidate other than Biden, he would probably be a part of the conversation.
Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina

Gov. Roy Cooper isn't a big name among Democratic voters outside North Carolina, at least not yet. The former state lawmaker, onetime North Carolina attorney general, and current two-term governor rose through the ranks of government and, along the way, navigated political divides that would bedevil most politicians.
In a GOP-leaning state where Democratic candidates have to compete on tricky terrain, Cooper, a moderate, has come out on top.
Democrats have not tapped a Southern governor as their presidential nominee since Bill Clinton in 1992. Looking to the future, probably in 2028, Cooper is someone who's poised to be on the minds of many in the party.
Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland

Gov. Wes Moore, an Army veteran who's also a Rhodes Scholar, was first elected to the governorship in 2022. He has focused heavily on tackling issues such as child poverty and housing affordability, two of the most vexing public-policy challenges for leaders on both the state and federal levels.
One of Moore's major pushes is to reshape how patriotism is defined in politics, as he told Business Insider during his first gubernatorial campaign that one party or movement couldn't claim the idea as their own.
""I refuse to let anybody try to wrestle that away,"" Moore told BI in an October 2022 interview, ""or claim that they have a higher stake or some higher claim to it than I or my family or people who I served with or my community members.""
The governor, seen by many as a potential 2028 contender, has been a strong political ally of both Biden and Harris.
While Moore may be relatively new to elective politics, his profile only continues to grow within the Democratic Party.
Correction: February 23, 2024 — An earlier version of this story misstated one of President Joe Biden's arguments for why he should be reelected. He has touted low national unemployment numbers, not low national employment numbers.

Thousands gather at White House for pro-Palestinian protest,https://www.yahoo.com/news/thousands-gather-white-house-pro-200032831.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",1:30 AM GMT+5:30,2 min read,"Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the White House on Saturday to protest Joe Biden’s response to Israel’s ongoing military strikes on Gaza.
Footage posted to social media showed police using pepper spray on protesters, who faced arrest at the mass demonstration.
At least one demonstrator also held a canister that released green and white smoke near the southern side of the White House.
The demonstrator, who was dressed as the superhero character Spiderman, shouted along with a crowd: “Biden, Biden, we can’t wait! We’ll see you at the Hague!”
The Hague is the Dutch city that is home to the international criminal court that prosecutes war crimes.
The protest comes after criticism aimed at the president over his handling of Israel’s continued strikes on Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas.

Saturday’s demonstration featured a coalition of groups including Code Pink and the Council on American Islamic Relation, Reuters reported.
Biden has claimed that Israel’s latest attacks on Rafah do not violate the US’s red line – or, limit – with respect to support for its ally.
The Biden administration has continued to provide American weapons to Israel, even as the Israeli military launched an airstrike against a tent city in Rafah two weeks earlier that killed at least 45 people.
Saturday’s protest also comes days after Biden told Time magazine that there is “every reason” to believe that the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is prolonging the war in Gaza for his own political gain – accusations the Israeli government has criticized.
On Saturday, protesters held a red banner around the perimeter of the White House to symbolize the US’s red line with respect to Israel.
They also held up Palestinian flags and protest signs decrying what they describe as a genocide in Gaza.
“Biden, you got blood on your hands,” read one protest sign.
Another sign simply read: “Free Palestine.”
Demonstrators shouted slogans that condemned the president’s response, including: “Biden, Biden, you’re a sellout. Pack your bags and get the hell out!”
Protesters will reportedly be surrounding the White House all day.
Saturday marks eight months since Israel’s current war against Gaza began, after Hamas killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 people hostage during the 7 October attack.
Since the war began, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s military attacks.
Gaza has also been pushed into a humanitarian crisis amid widespread hunger and disease within the territory.

Biden easily won Virginia in the 2020 presidential election. But things look a lot different this year.,https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-easily-won-virginia-2020-192554768.html,"Sun, June 9, 2024",12:55 AM GMT+5:30,4 min read,"Virginia is a foundational piece of President Joe Biden's road map for winning a second term.
However, recent polling in the state shows Biden and Trump tied or nearly tied among voters.
Republicans now believe Trump has a fighting chance in the state.
In 2020, it was a foregone conclusion that Joe Biden would win Virginia in that year's presidential contest.
Four years earlier, Donald Trump lost the state to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, even as he captured the White House. Trump never built firm political footing in Virginia, and his unpopularity there fueled major Republican losses in state legislative races in 2017 and 2019 — especially in suburban swing districts.
Biden's considerable standing among Black voters, independents, and voters aged 18 to 29 buoyed the onetime vice president to a huge 10-point victory over Trump in Virginia in 2020.
But as the 2024 contest enters its critical summer stretch, recent polling shows Biden and Trump are now deadlocked in Virginia, a development that has major implications for both candidates.
Will Biden have to spend time campaigning in a state that many he already had in the bag? Is Trump getting a third look from voters who previously rejected him twice?
Here's a look at the state of the race in Virginia, where Biden holds some significant advantages ahead of November:
Why is Biden lagging in Virginia?
The latest Fox News survey of registered Virginia voters showed Biden and Trump tied with 48% support, while Biden held a one-point lead (42% to 41%) when the race included third-party candidates. A Roanoke College poll taken last month showed Biden and Trump tied at 42% support among likely voters, with 8% of respondents indicating that they would back independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
These numbers represent a softening on Biden's part, as he won 54% of the state's votes in 2020, compared to Trump's 44%.
In the Fox News poll, Biden had a 42% favorability rating and a 43% job approval rating, which align with many of his national polling figures. While Virginia has largely trended Democratic in recent years, Biden's numbers are a reminder that it is not a reliably blue state, but one with a blue tinge. (Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's election in 2021 reflects that.)

While Virginia voters give Biden high marks on issues like climate change, abortion rights, and election integrity, it is Trump who comes out on top on issues like the economy, the Israel-Hamas war, and immigration.
Since the latter three issues routinely rank as some of voters' biggest concerns, this has allowed Trump to poll competitively with Biden in Virginia.
The Fox News poll also showed Trump winning an unusually high 25% of Black voters, a figure that if realized would represent a modern record for a GOP presidential nominee in the state. And the survey showed no polling gap between voters aged 18 to 29 and those aged 65 years and older, with the candidates tied at 48% among both age groups.
What boosts Biden's chances in the state?
In recent years, Democrats have solidified their support in Virginia's most populous regions — from Northern Virginia to the Richmond metropolitan area and down to Hampton Roads. These areas contain scores of suburban communities where moderates from both parties, as well as independents, generally decide statewide elections.
Many of these voters tend to lean toward Biden, given their most recent voting trends.

In the Fox News poll, Biden led Trump among independents (45% to 43%) despite his diminished standing in the state. And Biden still retained robust majorities from college-educated voters (56%) and suburban women (58%) — blocs crucial for the president and down-ballot Democrats.
And in Northern Virginia — an electoral gold mine for Democrats — Trump remains unpopular. If turnout is high in the region, Trump must post massive numbers in rural Virginia and downstate exurbs to win.
Youngkin, in a recent Fox News interview, said the recent polling numbers meant Virginia would be ""in play"" in November.
But surveys closer to Labor Day will likely offer a clearer sense of the true nature of Virginia's competitiveness, as many voters remain tuned out of the election — while some who are currently leaning toward third-party candidates may return to Biden's fold.
